Though the increasing acceptance of preprints is driving policy changes for journals and funders, there is little information about their usage. Here, we collected and analyzed data on all 37,648 preprints uploaded to bioRxiv.org, the largest biology-focused preprint server, in its first five years. We find preprints are being downloaded more than ever before (1.1 million tallied in October 2018 alone) and that the rate of preprints being posted has increased to a recent high of 2,100 per month. We also find that two-thirds of preprints posted before 2017 were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and find a relationship between journal impact factor and preprint downloads. Lastly, we developed Rxivist.org, a web application providing multiple ways of interacting with preprint metadata.}

Our research uses a person‐centered approach to examine subgroups of participants in a social movement against inequality on the basis of their social class, intention to participate in conventional and/or radical collective actions, and social identification with the movement. We used longitudinal data from the Chilean student movement (two time points; total               N               \,=\,1226) to conduct latent profile and latent transition analysis. We identified four profiles of participants: (1) inactive supporters (mostly from the upper class), (2) low radicals (mostly from the middle class), (3) moderate radicals (mostly from the middle class), and (4) high radicals (mostly from the middle class). The four profiles were generally stable over the one‐year period. We further found that group efficacy and a “nothing to lose” mindset predicted the profile membership of participants. Group efficacy also predicted transitions of participants between different profiles. Our findings highlight the key role that the middle class plays in diverse forms of collective action.},

  abstract = {This study aims to investigate the relationship between good governance and its effects on social order, social commitment, and citizens' belief in social values in the city of Garmsar, Iran. Good governance is considered a key factor in fostering social cohesion and public trust, especially in diverse communities like Garmsar. By analyzing these relationships, the study seeks to highlight the impact of governance practices on social dynamics. The research employs a quantitative survey design, using a structured questionnaire to collect data from a sample of 384 citizens in Garmsar. Participants were selected using multi-stage cluster and quota sampling techniques to ensure demographic representation. The questionnaire assessed perceptions of good governance, social order, social commitment, and belief in social values using a Likert scale. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation tests was conducted to explore the relationships between the variables. The findings reveal significant positive correlations between good governance and all three dimensions studied. Good governance was moderately correlated with social commitment (r = 0.366, p {$<$} 0.01) and social order (r = 0.321, p {$<$} 0.01), while the relationship with belief in social values was weaker but still significant (r = 0.181, p {$<$} 0.01). These results suggest that effective governance contributes to stronger social cohesion and commitment, though its influence on citizens' belief in social values is less pronounced. The study concludes that good governance plays a critical role in enhancing social order and commitment among citizens. While governance positively influences belief in social values, other cultural and religious factors may also play a significant role. Strengthening transparency, accountability, and public participation is essential for fostering social cohesion in ethnically diverse communities like Garmsar.}

While factors associated with scientific culture and practical practice are most often invoked, I propose that the Crisis of Reproducibility is ultimately a failure of generalization with a fundamental scientific basis in the methods used for biomedical research. The Denominator Problem describes how limitations intrinsic to the two primary approaches of biomedical research, clinical studies and preclinical experimental biology, lead to an inability to effectively characterize the full extent of biological heterogeneity, which compromises the task of generalizing acquired knowledge. Drawing on the example of the unifying role of theory in the physical sciences, I propose that multi-scale mathematical and dynamic computational models, when mapped to the modular structure of biological systems, can serve a unifying role as formal representations of what is conserved and similar from one biological context to another. This ability to explicitly describe the generation of heterogeneity from similarity addresses the Denominator Problem and provides a scientific response to the Crisis of Reproducibility.},

This study examines perceptions of social cohesion among               E               uropeans and explains variations in those perceptions by considering the separate and combined effects of economic strain and institutional trust. Analyses were conducted with the 27 member countries of the               EU               based on the Eurobarometer 74.1 on poverty and social exclusion conducted in 2010. Results show that individuals living in households experiencing economic strain perceive social cohesion to be weaker than their less economically hard‐pressed counterparts. By contrast, individuals trusting their political institutions perceived there to be higher levels of cohesion. Furthermore, institutional trust substantially moderates the negative relationship between economic strain and perceptions of cohesion. These results are robust to various model specifications. Moreover, extending the analysis revealed that this moderating effect held when considering social relations between the poor and rich and between different racial and ethnic groups. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

This article argues that this thesis may not be appropriate to understand societies with different cultural traditions and institutional practices. Based upon the results of qualitative research conducted in Chile the article discusses the existence of a specific path to individuation in this society. The data show the analytical preeminence within the individuation process in Chile of a group of competences that must be generated and developed in confronting social life itself. Individuation leads in Chile to the constitution of relational hyper-actors based upon four dimensions: self-effort, abilities, interpersonal relationships and pragmatic consistency. This is what we propose to understand as agentic individualism.},

  abstract = {The sociological study of individuation processes in modern occidental societies has mobilized the thesis of institutional individualism as a key concept. This article argues that this thesis may not be appropriate to understand societies with different cultural traditions and institutional practices. Based upon the results of qualitative research conducted in Chile the article discusses the existence of a specific path to individuation in this society. The data show the analytical preeminence within the individuation process in Chile of a group of competences that must be generated and developed in confronting social life itself. Individuation leads in Chile to the constitution of relational hyper-actors based upon four dimensions: self-effort, abilities, interpersonal relationships and pragmatic consistency. This is what we propose to understand as agentic individualism.},

Se entrevistó a 1 mil 759 estudiantes de seis bachilleratos distintos, a través de un muestreo no probabilístico, por cuotas. Los resultados muestran que la madre o tutora es la figura que más influye en la elección de una carrera STEM en comparación con el padre o tutor. Se pensó que los hermanos podrían tener un efecto mayor en los estudiantes, no obstante, los resultados muestran que no es significativo que tengan o no hermanos y que estos puedan influir en la elección de carrera. Sin embargo, es necesario profundizar más en el estudio de los hermanos mayores que egresan de carreras STEM y el efecto que esto tiene en la elección de los hermanos menores, aspecto que no se abordó en la investigación. El estudio no profundizo en variables como: el tipo de carrera y el rol laboral que desempeñan los padres y si está o no relacionado con las áreas STEM. Se concluye que las familias deben realizar actividades no formales que ayuden a despertar el interés en la ciencia y aumentar su capital cultural desde edades tempranas.             Society experiences scientific and technological changes that are forcing economies to focus their attention on the development of human capital with a profile in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This article aims to demonstrate the influence of the family (mother or guardian father or guardian and siblings) on the choice of STEM careers in high school students during their second and sixth semester, since choosing a career is an individual and family decision. A total of 1,759 students from six different high schools were interviewed, through a non-probabilistic sampling, by quotas. The results show that the mother or guardian is the figure that most influences the choice of a STEM career compared to the father or guardian. It was thought that siblings could have a greater effect on students, however, the results show that it is not significant that they have siblings or that siblings can influence their choice. However, it is necessary to go deeper into the study of older brothers who graduate from STEM degrees and the effect this has on the younger brother’s election, an aspect that was not addressed in the investigation. The study did not delve into variables such as the type of career and the labor role played by parents and whether or not it is related to STEM areas. In conclusion, families must carry out non-formal activities that help awaken interest in science and increase their cultural capital from an early age.},

Mediante 24 entrevistas, este artículo reúne los relatos de vidas de 12 estudiantes universitarios que abandonan la iglesia católica y se proclaman como “sin religión” y, a su vez, otros 12 jóvenes que realizan el proceso contrario; a través de un análisis temático, se establece la existencia de dos pares opuestos que intervienen en estas decisiones: el dilema de la (in)necesidad de Dios y el dilema de la (des)confianza en la Iglesia. Identificamos que la individuación y el declive de las instituciones influyen en la forma de enfrentar estos dilemas.},

Opportunistic use of `researcher degrees of freedom' aimed at obtaining statistical significance increases the likelihood of obtaining and publishing false positive results and overestimated effect sizes. Preregistration is a mechanism for reducing such degrees of freedom by specifying designs and analysis plans before observing the research outcomes. The effectiveness of preregistration may depend, in part, on whether the process facilitates sufficiently specific articulation of such plans. In this preregistered study, we compared two formats of preregistration available on the OSF: Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration and Prereg Challenge registration (now called “OSF Preregistration”, http://osf.io/prereg/). The Prereg Challenge format was a structured workflow with detailed instructions, and an independent review to confirm completeness; the “Standard” format was unstructured with minimal direct guidance to give researchers flexibility for what to pre-specify. Results of comparing random samples of 53 preregistrations from each format indicate that the structured format restricted the opportunistic use of researcher degrees of freedom better (Cliff's Delta = 0.49) than the unstructured format, but neither eliminated all researcher degrees of freedom. We also observed very low concordance among coders about the number of hypotheses (14\%), indicating that they are often not clearly stated. We conclude that effective preregistration is challenging, and registration formats that provide effective guidance may improve the quality of research.},

A fines del siglo XX y principios del XXI se inició una reacción en las más prestigiosas bibliotecas y comunidades científicas de América del Norte y Europa Occidental, y América Latina comenzó el desarrollo de sistemas de visibilidad propios, al tiempo que sucesivas declaraciones fueron definiendo al Acceso Abierto como estrategia para superar tales inequidades. En esta dirección, se han desarrollado revistas en Acceso Abierto cuya sustentabilidad está siendo puesta a prueba. Este trabajo presenta un breve estado de situación actualizado sobre algunos problemas que enfrentan los autores, evaluadores y editores latinoamericanos en la gestión y publicación de los resultados de las investigaciones. Asimismo, en él se argumenta en pro del Acceso Abierto como herramienta primordial para garantizar la soberanía del conocimiento en el Sur Global, y se sostiene que la propuesta colaborativa para la construcción conjunta de un sistema sustentable de edición científica en Acceso Abierto puede ayudar a superar las inequidades en la producción y difusión del conocimiento latinoamericano},

One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A—make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B—use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate.

  abstract = {Latin American and East Asian cultures are generally considered to be collectivistic cultures. However, there are very few cross-cultural studies contrasting these two cultures against each other, as most studies in this field compare them to Western culture. Self-construal is one of the most used constructs to explain cultural differences, elucidating whether individuals of a cultural group see themselves as independent of their environment and others, focusing on personal motivations, or interdependent of others and their context, recognizing their role within it. This study intends to compare the self-construal of Chileans and South Koreans and observe the variability in the presence of these dimensions in these two cultures. A total of 200 participants from Chile and South Korea responded to the Self-Construal Scale. Chileans presented significantly higher scores on independent and interdependent self-construal simultaneously when compared to South Koreans. Also, Chileans presented higher scores on independent self-construal than on interdependent self-construal, while Koreans did not show a preference for either dimension. These results are consistent with previous studies on Chileans, implying that not all Latin American countries would adhere to collectivism.},

This study intends to compare the self-construal of Chileans and South Koreans and observe the variability in the presence of these dimensions in these two cultures. A total of 200 participants from Chile and South Korea responded to the Self-Construal Scale. Chileans presented significantly higher scores on independent and interdependent self-construal simultaneously when compared to South Koreans. Also, Chileans presented higher scores on independent self-construal than on interdependent self-construal, while Koreans did not show a preference for either dimension. These results are consistent with previous studies on Chileans, implying that not all Latin American countries would adhere to collectivism.},

  abstract = {Background. The p-curve is a plot of the distribution of p-values reported in a set of scientific studies. Comparisons between ranges of p-values have been used to evaluate fields of research in terms of the extent to which studies have genuine evidential value, and the extent to which they suffer from bias in the selection of variables and analyses for publication, p-hacking. Methods. p-hacking can take various forms. Here we used R code to simulate the use of ghost variables, where an experimenter gathers data on several dependent variables but reports only those with statistically significant effects. We also examined a text-mined dataset used by Head et al. (2015) and assessed its suitability for investigating p-hacking. Results. We show that when there is ghost p-hacking, the shape of the p-curve depends on whether dependent variables are intercorrelated. For uncorrelated variables, simulated p-hacked data do not give the "p-hacking bump" just below .05 that is regarded as evidence of p-hacking, though there is a negative skew when simulated variables are inter-correlated. The way p-curves vary according to features of underlying data poses problems when automated text mining is used to detect p-values in heterogeneous sets of published papers. Conclusions. The absence of a bump in the p-curve is not indicative of lack of p-hacking. Furthermore, while studies with evidential value will usually generate a right-skewed p-curve, we cannot treat a right-skewed p-curve as an indicator of the extent of evidential value, unless we have a model specific to the type of p-values entered into the analysis. We conclude that it is not feasible to use the p-curve to estimate the extent of p-hacking and evidential value unless there is considerable control over the type of data entered into the analysis. In particular, p-hacking with ghost variables is likely to be missed.},

Reuse provides an opportunity to study the raw materials of past research projects to gain methodological and substantive insights.

We address these metatheoretical issues by developing Parsons’s analysis of positive and residual categories in various respects, including a focus on mutual support as the basis of positivity, differentiating synectic (reconcilable) and antinomic (irreconcilable) residual categories, and distinguishing divisions that are central to systems from those between center and periphery.

We identify major contradictions between the two culture models, which result in contradictory relationships with external variables such as economic prosperity. We critically evaluate the content validity of the items used to measure this construct in both models. Based on our analysis, we suggest that Hofstede's Individualism–Collectivism index be relabelled as Self-orientation vs Work-orientation and GLOBE's In-group collectivism as Family Collectivism. We demonstrate how the proposed alternative conceptualizations of the Individualism–Collectivism dimensions in both the Hofstede and GLOBE models can help reconcile the anomalous relationships between these two models of national culture, and between their dimension scores and other external variables of interest to researchers. We recommend a way forward for future research incorporating the collectivism dimensions that identifies which of the Hofstede/GLOBE scores is appropriate for differing purposes. This will help to make future research findings clearer, and to reduce contradictions and anomalies. Implications drawn from such research should also be clearer as a result.},

Political science also shows signs of reworking itself in response to these crises. Sociology sits on the sidelines. There have not been the same reliability or ethical scandals, at least not in the limelight, nor has there been strong disciplinary moves toward open science. This paper therefore investigates sociology as a discipline looking at current practices, definitions of sociology, positions of sociological associations and a brief consideration of the arguments of three highly influential sociologists: Weber, Merton and Habermas. Based on this disciplinary review, I suggest that sociology is no different from its neighboring disciplines in terms of reliability or ethical dilemmas. Therefore, sociology should adopt open science practices immediately. Weber, Merton and Habermas – three very different social thinkers epistemologically – offer strong arguments that favor what we know as “open science” today. Open science promotes ethics and reliability, reduces fraud and ultimately increases the value of sociology for policymakers and the public.

Expertise, prior beliefs and attitudes of the researchers explain even less. Each model deployed to test the hypothesis was unique, which highlights a vast universe of research design variability that is normally hidden from view and suggests humility when presenting and interpreting scientific findings.},

This is done using a panel data of multiple waves of the World Values Surveys, whereby national income levels are instrumented for using exogenous oil price shocks. We find significant and substantial effects of national income on the level of trust in the economy. In particular, a 1\% increase in national income tends to cause an average increase of 1 percentage point (or more) in the likelihood that a person becomes trustful. We also identify crime and corruption as potential mechanisms that may lead to the reported causal effect and explore heterogeneous effects across individuals.},

Sport and exercise medicine (SEM) research is vulnerable to the same QRPs that pervade the biomedical and psychological sciences, producing false-positive results and inflated effect sizes. Approximately 90\% of biomedical research reports supported study hypotheses, provoking suspicion about the field-wide presence of systematic biases to facilitate study findings that confirm researchers' expectations. In this education review, we introduce three common QRPs (ie, HARKing, P-hacking and Cherry-picking), perform a cross-sectional study to assess the proportion of original SEM research that reports supported study hypotheses, and draw attention to existing solutions and resources to overcome QRPs that manifest in exploratory research. We hypothesised that {$>$}= 85\% of original SEM research studies would report supported study hypotheses. Two independent assessors systematically identified, screened, included, and extracted study data from original research articles published between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2019 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Sports Medicine, the American Journal of Sports Medicine, and the Journal of Orthopaedic \& Sports Physical Therapy. We extracted data relating to whether studies reported that the primary hypothesis was supported or rejected by the results. Study hypotheses, methodologies, and analysis plans were preregistered at the Open Science Framework. One hundred and twenty-nine original research studies reported at least one study hypothesis, of which 106 (82.2\%) reported hypotheses that were supported by study results. Of 106 studies reporting that primary hypotheses were supported by study results, 75 (70.8\%) studies reported that the primary hypothesis was fully supported by study results. The primary study hypothesis was partially supported by study results in 28 (26.4\%) studies. We detail open science practices and resources that aim to safe-guard against QRPs that bely the credibility and replicability of original research findings.},

Nos basamos en dos proyectos de investigación de carácter cualitativo, que han seguido las elecciones educativas de padres sobre sus hijos y de jóvenes sobre su futuro postsecundario. Con la transformación estructural que impulsa el giro neoliberal, surgen nuevos sectores populares en un contexto de amplia mercantilización de las relaciones sociales, que alcanza a la educación y la configura bajo la lógica del mercado. En tal dinámica, las elecciones educativas y su inscripción subjetiva —lo que hemos denominado {$<$}em{$>$}mercadeo educativo—{$<$}/em{$>$} permiten advertir un panorama nuevo de estratificación social. Las elecciones educacionales, aparentemente autónomas, van marcando la estratificación real y nueva de la sociedad. Este mercadeo educativo se proyecta como nexo entre estructura y subjetividad, formando a los sujetos en una alta individualización de su reproducción social.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {How do stances on public policies aimed at ethnic conflict resolution affect intergroup trust? Building on theories of prosociality, social identity, and intergroup bias, we expect redistributive policy preferences meant to resolve ethnic conflict to replace ethnicity as the main barrier to intergroup trust because their zero‐sum nature raises intergroup threat. We test our expectations in Chile's ongoing indigenous/nonindigenous conflict using behavioral trust games embedded in an online nationally representative quota survey (               n               ~=~1105). Results align with our expectation. Namely, a lack of shared ethnic identity between nonindigenous Chileans and indigenous Mapuche does not lower intergroup trust. However, shared stances on a policy that would raise taxes to spur development in indigenous communities do increase intergroup trust discrimination. We probe the psychological mechanism—meaningful policy‐based group identities—by testing whether trustor indigenous identification and trustor political ideology moderate the effect of trustee policy stances on intergroup trust. Results are consistent with our assumption that shared policy stances can, indeed, form the basis of a meaningful social identity. Hence the very policies meant to end intergroup conflict could potentially perpetuate or redirect it to institutional channels of representation.},

  abstract = {Las nuevas dinámicas de migración, conflicto interétnico, diferencias de clase socioeconómica y segregación social son de manera creciente puestas en confrontación en el debate público y cada vez más estudiadas por las Ciencias Sociales. Aceptar la creciente diversidad social que se origina a partir de los procesos de modernización y globalización implica promover una sociedad más inclusiva, respetuosa y equitativa, donde se acepte a las personas por quienes son, independientemente de sus diferencias culturales, étnicas, religiosas o de clase. Hasta ahora, las investigaciones en Sociología se han centrado frecuentemente en el análisis de la posición que ocupan distintos grupos sociales dentro de la estructura social y de los desafíos que enfrentan para lograr integrarse en la sociedad (Viveros Vigoya, 2016; Wade, 2000; Young, 2000). Al profundizar en esta línea de investigación se han dejado de lado dos elementos fundamentales. Por un lado, se ha estudiado en menor medida el proceso de inclusión social en las escuelas (Blanco, 2006) y la percepción que tienen los estudiantes sobre los demás grupos al relacionarse con ellos en su vida cotidiana, en el sentido de si aceptan o rechazan a determinados grupos sociales que son distintos al grupo de pertenencia en un espacio externo a la escuela, esto es, en sus vecindarios. Por otro lado, ha ido cobrando reciente relevancia el proceso mediante el cual se aprenden o reproducen las actitudes de las personas en relación con la aceptación o rechazo de determinados grupos sociales y la importancia de la escuela (Malak-Minkiewicz \& Torney-Purta, 2021; Sandoval-Hernández et al., 2018) y la familia (Bandura, 1969; Santander Ramírez et al., 2020) en este proceso, así como ciertos patrones de segregación territorial que influyen en la percepción y la confianza entre grupos distintos (Baldassarri y Abascal 2020; Fernández, et. al 2016; Coté y Erickson 2009). Utilizando datos de 4801 estudiantes y apoderados provenientes del Primer estudio de Formación Ciudadana en Chile de 2017, esta investigación pretende abordar los distintos procesos de socialización que están implicados en el aprendizaje de actitudes de aceptación o rechazo hacia diferentes grupos sociales en los vecindarios que habitan los estudiantes. Específicamente, mediante metodologías cuantitativas se espera demostrar, por un lado, que la familia y la escuela influyen en el proceso de aprendizaje de actitudes, donde además se espera que la escuela logre disminuir las desigualdades de origen. Por otro lado, se espera demostrar que ciertas características contextuales de los territorios influyen en la aceptación o rechazo de distintos grupos sociales. Los resultados dan cuenta de que dentro del proceso de socialización familiar son las actitudes de los apoderados (y no los recursos socioeconómicos) las que influyen en los estudiantes. En cuanto a las escuelas, el conocimiento cívico y un ambiente favorable a la discusión y el debate influyen positivamente en las actitudes de los estudiantes. Se discuten estos resultados en función de su relevancia para el debate público y la generación de políticas educativas.},

  abstract = {Technocratic cabinets and expert, non-political ministers appointed in otherwise partisan cabinets have become a common reality in recent decades in young and older democracies, but we know little about how citizens see this change and what values, perceptions and experiences drive their attitudes towards technocratic government. The article explores the latter topic by drawing on recent comparative survey data from nine countries, both young and consolidated democracies from Europe and Latin America. Two individual-level characteristics trigger particularly strong support for the replacement of politicians with experts: low political efficacy and authoritarian values. They are complemented by a third, somewhat weaker factor: corruption perception. At the macro level, technocracy appeals to citizens of countries where the quality of democracy is deficient and where technocratic cabinets are a part of historical legacy. Surprisingly, civic activism and, partially, satisfaction with democracy enhance technocratic orientation, indicating such attitudes are not expressions of alienation or depoliticisation.},

  abstract = {Technocratic cabinets and expert, non-political ministers appointed in otherwise partisan cabinets have become a common reality in recent decades in young and older democracies, but we know little about how citizens see this change and what values, perceptions and experiences drive their attitudes towards technocratic government. The article explores the latter topic by drawing on recent comparative survey data from nine countries, both young and consolidated democracies from Europe and Latin America. Two individual-level characteristics trigger particularly strong support for the replacement of politicians with experts: low political efficacy and authoritarian values. They are complemented by a third, somewhat weaker factor: corruption perception. At the macro level, technocracy appeals to citizens of countries where the quality of democracy is deficient and where technocratic cabinets are a part of historical legacy. Surprisingly, civic activism and, partially, satisfaction with democracy enhance technocratic orientation, indicating such attitudes are not expressions of alienation or depoliticisation.},

Two particularly worrisome practices are selective reporting of significant results and 'P-hacking'. The latter is the manipulation of data collection, usage, or analyses to obtain statistically significant outcomes. Here, we introduce the novel, to our knowledge, concepts of selective reporting of nonsignificant results and 'reverse P-hacking' whereby researchers ensure that tests produce a nonsignificant result. We test whether these practices occur in experiments in which researchers randomly assign subjects to treatment and control groups to minimise differences in confounding variables that might affect the focal outcome.

If researchers less often report significant findings and/or reverse P-hack to avoid significant outcomes that undermine the ethos that experimental and control groups only differ with respect to actively manipulated variables, we expect significant results from tests for group differences to be under-represented in the literature. We surveyed the behavioural ecology literature and found significantly more nonsignificant P-values reported for tests of group differences in potentially confounding variables than the expected 95\% (P = 0.005; N = 250 studies). This novel, to our knowledge, publication bias could result from selective reporting of nonsignificant results and/or from reverse P-hacking.

  abstract = {Transition to tertiary education is a key step for students, which usually involves the application of admission tests. In general, when contrasting different groups of people —mainly based on socio-economic variables—, analyzes of this type of evidence are mostly concentrated on averages test scores, where few studies incorporate a gender perspective. In this sense, this study focuses on the Chilean context, and concentrates the analysis in the upper tail of the scores —where the actual university admission is occurring—, and lower —where potential lack of learning opportunities is exposed— of the University Selection Test (PSU). At the same time, gender gaps are compared for the 2014-2018 period in the mentioned top and bottom zones of the distribution of test scores. Results indicate that there are persistent gaps that limit the possibilities for women to pursue university careers in areas related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Therefore, it is important that both public and university policies consider affirmative and complementary actions that may address these issues, considering the ongoing higher education reform and possible changes into the Chilean university admission system.},

However, it is worth pointing out that the gap is not uniform in all STEM fields. Women’s underrepresentation is more marked in physics, engineering, and computer science fields. Nowadays, the labor market is becoming more competitive, technology-based and demands a diverse workforce. Therefore, it is important to continue promoting the participation of women in STEM, and the universities play a leading role in it. Previous research has shown that early learning experiences in STEM can show female students that they can succeed in this fields. This paper describes a model for developing programming courses for pre-university students to promote the participation of young women in STEM programs. The course was developed in one week, 25 students (16 girls and 9 boys) participated. The instructors of the course were four female professors. The programming language was Python, and the methodology used case-based learning. Both instructors and students gave positive comments on their experience in the course. The proposed model, including instruments, learning resources, and methodology, can be replicated and adapted to be used even in other learning fields.},

  abstract = {El panorama religioso chileno atraviesa momentos de cambios, marcado por el fin de la hegemonía de la Iglesia católica, la consolidación de las iglesias evangélicas como actores púbicos relevantes y el aumento de la población no religiosa. Esta investigación busca abordar uno de estos movimientos: la deconversión, o el cambio de la identidad religiosa de un individuo hacia la no-religión.Se realizaron entrevistas a 21 individuos que han atravesado procesos de deconversión en la ciudad de Temuco. Un análisis temático-narrativo permitió identificar cuatro tipos de narrativas: a) secularistas sólidos; b) secularistas líquidos; c) yo-liberados; y d) creyentes sin iglesia. Además, se encontró un grupo de temáticas transversal a las otras cuatro, que apunta a la particularidad de la experiencia femenina dentro y fuera de la religión.En general, las narrativas enfatizan los procesos de deconversión como trayectorias de autorrealización, resaltando valores de la autonomía y bienestar personal, a la vez que muestran una fuerte desconfianza hacia las instituciones religiosas.},

  abstract = {This article examines macro‐level contextual parameters and individual‐based factors deemed in the literature to directly influence individuals’ daily mobility practices. It considers the urban structure, place of residence, situation in the social hierarchy, and position in the life course. Taking its inspiration from approaches highlighting segregation at destination place and studies focusing on mobility biographies, it enquires whether systematic discrepancies may be detected between the places frequented for work or study on a daily basis by the groups of individuals residing in the same neighborhood. It also looks at whether home location (in a central area, inner suburb, or outskirt) influences how action spaces are configured. The analysis relies on a three‐phase integrated method. First, a typology of individuals is assembled to put together homogenous socio‐demographic groups. Second, the action spaces of these groups are calculated and mapped. Third, the significance of spatial differences in action spaces is assessed using a bivariate colocation test, hitherto used primarily in spatial epidemiology. This three‐phase method is applied to data collected in Santiago de Chile during a survey of 1,000 households, designed to capture spatial mobility from a biographical perspective.},

For the case of the German right‐wing populist party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) the authors propose a complex definition of rurality, and perform a quantitative small‐scale analysis of the national election results in Germany in 2017. They examine the potential connection between a high share of votes for the AfD and the rurality of a municipality. The results show that in eastern Germany, the fairly rural municipalities have comparatively high AfD vote shares, whereas in western Germany, the fairly rural and the non‐rural municipalities have similar AfD vote shares. Therefore, it appears that the thesis that rural areas are the source of the support of right‐wing populism applies to some, but not to all rural areas of Germany.},

We also demonstrate certain peculiarities of this political project, which differentiates it from its European brethren. In           fact, the party has adopted very clear neoliberal positions and puts much more emphasis on outgroup distinctions within rather than outside           the nation. Moreover, given that José Antonio Kast and the Partido Republicano maintain a very fluid relationship with the mainstream right,           collaboration between the two seems much simpler and more feasible than in most European cases.},

Continued immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity have prompted this essential question for modern societies, but few clear answers have been reached in the sprawling literature. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust through a narrative review and a meta-analysis of 1,001 estimates from 87 studies. The review clarifies the core concepts, highlights pertinent debates, and tests core claims from the literature on the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust. Several results stand out from the meta-analysis. We find a statistically significant negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust across all studies. The relationship is stronger for trust in neighbors and when ethnic diversity is measured more locally. Covariate conditioning generally changes the relationship only slightly. The review concludes by discussing avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract..There is growing concern and mounting evidence of selectivity in empirical economics. Most empirical economic literatures have a truncated distribution of results. The aim of this paper is to explore the link between publication selectivity and theory contests. This link is confirmed through the analysis of 87 distinct empirical economics literatures, involving more than three and a half thousand separate empirical studies, using objective measures of both selectivity and contests. Our meta–meta-analysis shows that publication selection is widespread, but not universal. It distorts scientific inference with potentially adverse effects on policy making, but competition and debate between rival theories reduces this selectivity and thereby improves economic inference.},

This distinction can be achieved by preregistration, a method that has recently attracted widespread attention. Although preregistration is fair in the sense that it inoculates researchers against hindsight bias and confirmation bias, preregistration does not allow researchers to analyze the data flexibly without the analysis being demoted to exploratory. To alleviate this concern we discuss how researchers may conduct blinded analyses (MacCoun and Perlmutter in Nature 526:187-189, 2015). As with preregistration, blinded analyses break the feedback loop between the analysis plan and analysis outcome, thereby preventing cherry-picking and significance seeking. However, blinded analyses retain the flexibility to account for unexpected peculiarities in the data. We discuss different methods of blinding, offer recommendations for blinding of popular experimental designs, and introduce the design for an online blinding protocol.},

They argued that, whereas right-skewed p-curves indicate true underlying effects, left-skewed p-curves indicate selective reporting of significant results when there is no true effect ("p-hacking"). We first review previous research showing that, in contrast to the first claim, null effects may produce right-skewed p-curves under some conditions. We then question the second claim by showing that not only selective reporting but also selective nonreporting of significant results due to a significant outcome of a more popular alternative test of the same hypothesis may produce left-skewed p-curves, even if all studies reflect true effects. Hence, just as right-skewed p-curves do not necessarily imply evidential value, left-skewed p-curves do not necessarily imply p- hacking and absence of true effects in the studies involved.},

Many surveys have asked scientists directly whether they have committed or know of a colleague who committed research misconduct, but their results appeared difficult to compare and synthesize. This is the first meta-analysis of these surveys. To standardize outcomes, the number of respondents who recalled at least one incident of misconduct was calculated for each question, and the analysis was limited to behaviours that distort scientific knowledge: fabrication, falsification, “cooking” of data, etc… Survey questions on plagiarism and other forms of professional misconduct were excluded. The final sample consisted of 21 surveys that were included in the systematic review, and 18 in the meta-analysis. A pooled weighted average of 1.97\% (N = 7, 95\%CI: 0.86–4.45) of scientists admitted to have fabricated, falsified or modified data or results at least once –a serious form of misconduct by any standard– and up to 33.7\% admitted other questionable research practices. In surveys asking about the behaviour of colleagues, admission rates were 14.12\% (N = 12, 95\% CI: 9.91–19.72) for falsification, and up to 72\% for other questionable research practices. Meta-regression showed that self reports surveys, surveys using the words “falsification” or “fabrication”, and mailed surveys yielded lower percentages of misconduct. When these factors were controlled for, misconduct was reported more frequently by medical/pharmacological researchers than others.

  abstract = {Recent research to analyze and discuss cultural differences has employed a combination of five major dimensions of individualism–collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, femininity–masculinity (gender role differentiation), and long-term orientation. Among these dimensions, individualism–collectivism has received the most attention. Chronologically, this cultural attribute has been regarded as one, then two, and more recently, four dimensions of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism. However, research on this issue has not been conclusive and some have argued against this expansion. The current study attempts to explain and clarify this discussion by using a shortened version of the scale developed by Singelis et al. ((1995) Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: a theoretical and measurement refinement. Cross-Cultural Research 29(3): 240–275).

  abstract = {Recent research to analyze and discuss cultural differences has employed a combination of five major dimensions of individualism–collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, femininity–masculinity (gender role differentiation), and long-term orientation. Among these dimensions, individualism–collectivism has received the most attention. Chronologically, this cultural attribute has been regarded as one, then two, and more recently, four dimensions of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism. However, research on this issue has not been conclusive and some have argued against this expansion. The current study attempts to explain and clarify this discussion by using a shortened version of the scale developed by Singelis et al. ((1995) Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: a theoretical and measurement refinement. Cross-Cultural Research 29(3): 240–275).

A total of 12 women who graduated between 2013 and 2017 were interviewed; six of them studied specialties that are traditional for women and six were trained in highly maledominated sectors. Our research, of a qualitative nature, leads us to question the concept of ‘choice’, since admission to this educational modality is strongly conditioned by economic and mobility factors. In the stage of selecting a specialty, it becomes apparent that there are subjective factors that motivate women to insert themselves into traditionally femaledominated areas or, instead, to challenge the gender mandates reproduced by some teachers or family members. After completing their secondary vocational and training education, the women often experience sexism and sexual harassment when engaging in internship programs, which, in some cases, generates disaffection towards male-dominated jobs. The decision to continue an educational project, to enter the working world, or to make both compatible, is mediated by socioeconomic restrictions, by maternity, and by the lack of family support networks. In summary, class, gender, geographic origin, and other variables intersect to condition the educational and professional trajectories of women.},

However, it seems that data sharing is a not fully adopted behavior among researchers. The theory of planned behavior was repeatedly applied to explain drivers of data sharing from the perspective of data donors (researchers).

Design/methodology/approach To answer the RQs, a mixed methods approach was applied, consisting of a qualitative prestudy and a quantitative survey including an experimental component. The latter was a two-group setup with an intervention group (A) and a control group (B). A list-based recruiting of members of the Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg was applied for 15 days. For exploratory data analysis of dropouts and nonresponse, we used Fisher's exact tests and binary logistic regressions. Findings In sum, we recorded 197 cases for Group A and 198 cases for Group B. We found no systematic group differences regarding response bias or dropout. Furthermore, we gained insights into the experiences our sample made with data sharing: half of our sample already requested data of other researchers or shared data on request of other researchers.

However, it seems that data sharing is a not fully adopted behavior among researchers. The theory of planned behavior was repeatedly applied to explain drivers of data sharing from the perspective of data donors (researchers). However, data sharing can be viewed from another perspective as well: survey participants. The research questions (RQs) for this study were as follows: 1 Does data sharing increase participant's nonresponse? 2 Does data sharing influence participant's response behavior? The purpose of this paper is to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach To answer the RQs, a mixed methods approach was applied, consisting of a qualitative prestudy and a quantitative survey including an experimental component. The latter was a two-group setup with an intervention group (A) and a control group (B). A list-based recruiting of members of the Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg was applied for 15 days. For exploratory data analysis of dropouts and nonresponse, we used Fisher's exact tests and binary logistic regressions. Findings In sum, we recorded 197 cases for Group A and 198 cases for Group B. We found no systematic group differences regarding response bias or dropout. Furthermore, we gained insights into the experiences our sample made with data sharing: half of our sample already requested data of other researchers or shared data on request of other researchers. Data repositories, however, were used less frequently: 28\% of our respondents used data from repositories and 19\% stored data in a repository. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, their study is the first study that includes researchers as survey subjects investigating the effect of data sharing on their response patterns.},

  abstract = {In 2015, Comparative Political Studies embarked on a landmark pilot study in research transparency in the social sciences. The editors issued an open call for submissions of manuscripts that contained no mention of their actual results, incentivizing reviewers to evaluate manuscripts based on their theoretical contributions, research designs, and analysis plans. The three papers in this special issue are the result of this process that began with 19 submissions. In this article, we describe the rationale for this pilot, expressly articulating the practices of preregistration and results-free review. We document the process of carrying out the special issue with a discussion of the three accepted papers, and critically evaluate the role of both preregistration and results-free review. Our main conclusions are that results-free review encourages much greater attention to theory and research design, but that it raises thorny problems about how to anticipate and interpret null findings. We also observe that as currently practiced, results-free review has a particular affinity with experimental and cross-case methodologies. Our lack of submissions from scholars using qualitative or interpretivist research suggests limitations to the widespread use of results-free review.},

We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of you can publish if you found a significant effect'. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of you can publish if your study is rigorous'. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one's own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of impact' almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.},

Utilizando infor- mación de la Encuesta LAPOP entre los años 2008 y 2014, junto a datos para paı́ses, esta investigación evalúa la aplicabilidad que tiene para América Latina la supuesta asociación inversa entre estrato de ingreso y acuerdo con la reducción de brechas por medio del Estado, analizando el efecto de la desigualdad y el desarrollo económico de los paı́ses en esta relación. Para ello, se emplean modelos hı́bridos de regresión multinivel, para 4 perı́odos de tiempo y 18 naciones, controlando por caracterı́sticas relevantes tanto de los paı́ses como de las personas. Los resultados dan cuenta de las escasas diferencias entre estratos económicos, demostrándose que, al contrario de como se ha evidenciado en otras regiones del planeta, el ingreso no logra con- stituirse como un determinante esencial sobre las preferencias redistributivas para la población latinoamericana. Más que aplicar en una variedad de contextos, el autointerés sólo emerge al interior de la región en sociedades económicamente más ricas. A la luz de los resultados, se establecen comparaciones con los hallazgos de investigaciones previas en paı́ses desarrollados, discutiéndose la aplicación de teorı́as racionalistas en materia de justicia y solidaridad social al interior de las sociedades que conforman nuestra región.},

We adopt a network model in which nodes represent survey variables and edges their conditional associations. This allows us to conceptualize perceptions, beliefs, and judgments about inequality as a network of connected evaluative reactions. We analyze data from the 2019 ISSP Social Inequality Module for Chile, one of the most unequal countries in the world. Relying on a network approach, we systematically analyze the wide-ranging indicators measuring subjective inequality. Results show that conceptions regarding inequality, redistribution, taxation, and wages form a moderately connected unified belief system with a small-world structure. In addition, we stratify the sample by education, income, and social class, obtaining six attitude networks. We compare the structures of these networks, investigating differences in community membership, node centrality, and network connectivity, evidencing that people in lower social positions have a more multidimensional understanding of inequality. Our work contributes to social justice research by proposing an innovative conceptualization of these attitudes and providing evidence of their structural variation across different socioeconomic groups.},

The first half of the article argues that a sociologically sophisticated understanding of replication must address both the ways that replication rules and conventions evolved within an epistemic culture and how those cultures are shaped by specific research challenges.

  abstract = {Science depends on trustworthy evidence. Thus, a biased scientific record is of questionable value because it impedes scientific progress, and the public receives advice on the basis of unreliable evidence that has the potential to have far-reaching detrimental consequences. Meta-analysis is a technique that can be used to summarize research evidence. However, meta-analytic effect size estimates may themselves be biased, threatening the validity and usefulness of meta-analyses to promote scientific progress. Here, we offer a large-scale simulation study to elucidate how p-hacking and publication bias distort meta-analytic effect size estimates under a broad array of circumstances that reflect the reality that exists across a variety of research areas. The results revealed that, first, very high levels of publication bias can severely distort the cumulative evidence. Second, p-hacking and publication bias interact: At relatively high and low levels of publication bias, p-hacking does comparatively little harm, but at medium levels of publication bias, p-hacking can considerably contribute to bias, especially when the true effects are very small or are approaching zero. Third, p-hacking can severely increase the rate of false positives. A key implication is that, in addition to preventing p-hacking, policies in research institutions, funding agencies, and scientific journals need to make the prevention of publication bias a top priority to ensure a trustworthy base of evidence. Translational Abstract In recent years, the trustworthiness of psychological science has been questioned. A major concern is that many research findings are less robust than the published evidence suggests. Several reasons may contribute to this state of affairs. Two prominently discussed reasons are that (a) researchers use questionable research practices (so called p-hacking) when they analyze the data of their empirical studies, and (b) studies that revealed results consistent with expectations are more likely published than studies that "failed" (publication bias). The present large-scale simulation study estimates the extent to which meta-analytic effect sizes are biased by different degrees of p-hacking and publication bias, considering several factors of influence that may impact on this bias (e.g., the true effect of the phenomenon of interest). Results show that both p-hacking and publication bias contribute to a potentially severely biased impression of the overall evidence. This is especially the case when the true effect that is investigated is very small or does not exist at all. Severe publication bias alone can exert considerable bias; p-hacking exerts considerable bias only when there is also publication bias. However, p-hacking can severely increase the rate of false positives, that is, findings that suggest that a study found a real effect when, in reality, no effect exists. A key implication of the present study is that, in addition to preventing p-hacking, policies in research institutions, funding agencies, and scientific journals need to make the prevention of publication bias a top priority to ensure a trustworthy base of evidence.},

  abstract = {Research has produced mixed results on the relationship between economic inequality and social and political trust. These studies overrepresent developed countries, cross-sectional designs, and overlook the role of subjective evaluations of inequality. We use 13 waves from 18 Latin American countries over 23 years (above 250,000 participants) to examine the association between structural inequality and fairness evaluations with political and social trust. Multilevel regression analyses for comparative longitudinal surveys suggest that within-country changes in economic inequality over time are negatively associated with political and social trust. However, between-country inequality was negatively related to social trust but not political trust. In addition, fairness evaluations of inequality were positively related to social and political trust. Exploratory analyses revealed that fairness evaluations mediated the negative association between economic inequality and political and social trust. We discussed that fairness evaluations of inequality may explain why inequality affects social and political trust.},

  abstract = {This article is divided into four parts which move the discussion from authenticity to consumerism to charismatic authority. The introduction discusses “what is authenticity,” and how social sciences can address the question. The article argues that authenticity claims can be classified in different registers, which in turn are part of overarching, socio-historical regimes. The rise of the culture of authenticity is the product of a change in such regimes, which have shifted from a “national-statist” to a new consumerist or “market” regime in the wake of the consumer revolution of the 1960s and the latest wave of economic globalisation. The third section turns to the issue of religious authority, starting with the diagnosis that consumer cultures are prone to a shift from rational-legal to charismatic types of authority, in reference to Max Weber’s typology.

  abstract = {This article is divided into four parts which move the discussion from authenticity to consumerism to charismatic authority. The introduction discusses “what is authenticity,” and how social sciences can address the question. The article argues that authenticity claims can be classified in different registers, which in turn are part of overarching, socio-historical regimes. The rise of the culture of authenticity is the product of a change in such regimes, which have shifted from a “national-statist” to a new consumerist or “market” regime in the wake of the consumer revolution of the 1960s and the latest wave of economic globalisation. The third section turns to the issue of religious authority, starting with the diagnosis that consumer cultures are prone to a shift from rational-legal to charismatic types of authority, in reference to Max Weber's typology. In response to the question as to why charismatic authorities arise in capitalist cultures, the article argues to their structural and coextensive nature. Finally, the last section revises Weber's typologies with the help of Mauss's Essay on the Gift and a contribution from sociologist Alain Caillé and develops some of their heuristic potential.},

  abstract = {Unlike the Spanish transition, and even the Argentine transition, there is something uncomfortable about the political "transformation" that took place in Chile at the end of the 1980s. There remained in the air the sensation of having consummated an equivalent to the Catholic transubstantiation of wine into blood, of having produced a form of "gatopardismo", of having had to recognize that the substance of the Chilean political regime is the continuity of its "oligarchism"; pardoning, yes, all these attempts at lexical inventions. The Chilean transition to democracy brought in its baggage the joy of the end of the dictatorship, at least for half of its citizen-voters, together with the sadness resulting from a deep conviction of irremediable defeat. This implied that dictatorship and democracy were no longer the old enemies of the 1920s and 1930s, no longer the opposites that the liberals placed before the communist enemy.},

En este artículo se examinan las actitudes hacia la violencia perpetrada en Chile por Carabineros contra manifestantes y la violencia ejercida por manifestantes contra Carabineros en el marco del contexto post estallido social del 18 de octubre de 2019. Se evalúa el papel que juegan la percepción de injusticia en los procedimientos y el trato de Carabineros hacia manifestantes, la evaluación de la legitimidad de Carabineros y la identificación grupal con manifestantes y Carabineros en predecir la justificación de la violencia hacia Carabineros y hacia manifestantes. Se presentan los resultados de una encuesta no-probabilística online sobre legitimidad y violencia policial realizada a adultos en Chile durante enero de 2021 (n = 2.594). A través de un análisis de sendero, se encontró que la percepción de injusticia en los procedimientos de trato de Carabineros hacia los manifestantes es un factor clave al predecir la percepción de legitimidad de esa institución. Es más, al reducir la legitimidad de Carabineros, la percepción de injusticia en los procedimientos y el trato se traducen en una menor justificación de la violencia de Carabineros y una mayor justificación de la violencia de manifestantes. El artículo termina destacando la importancia de considerar las percepciones de injusticia en los procedimientos y el trato de Carabineros para lograr reducir el conflicto entre estos y los manifestantes en protestas en Chile.}

  abstract = {What determines the vote in referenda: issue-preferences or second-order considerations? Scholars suggest issue-voting is stronger in salient elections. Based on survey data collected during Chile's constitutional referendum, the article challenges this argument. An innovative conjoint  experiment allows us to estimate if different elements of the constitution sunk the proposal. Coupled with vote choice models, results indicate that second-order considerations played a more important role than the literature predicts. We argue this is because studies mostly study referenda  on European integration in parliamentary systems. Unlike European integration, the constitutional proposal was not a cross-cutting "issue," but one tied to the incumbent. Presidentialism exacerbated government/opposition dynamics, such that the incumbent's popularity significantly affected  vote choice. We discuss why this is similar to what transpired in other Latin American countries and draw lessons for participatory democracy.},

Being a PhD candidate or junior researcher increased the odds of frequently engaging in at least one QRP, as did being male. Scientific norm subscription (odds ratio (OR) 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.63, 1.00) and perceived likelihood of detection by reviewers (OR 0.62, 95\% CI: 0.44, 0.88) were associated with engaging in less research misconduct. Publication pressure was associated with more often engaging in one or more QRPs frequently (OR 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.14, 1.30). We found higher prevalence of misconduct than earlier surveys.

Horizontal occupational segregation begins at the very moment in which women choose their degree since it will have a repercussion in their future for it affects their future decisions, their future working life, their fields of expertise and even there are learning methodologies linked to gender. The presence of stereotypes and role models affecting the occupational breakdown by gender are catalysts of the intrinsic constraints (internalized beliefs) and extrinsic constraints (those linked to the norms and existing procedures, or the absence of them in higher education), since they discourage the irruption of women in fields which have been traditionally associated to men. With regards to higher education, women tend to enroll in the fields of health, education and social services whilst men focus on STEM fields.

Some articles explicitly disclosed funding sources (or lack of; 74/236, 31\% [25\% to 37\%]) and some declared no conflicts of interest (36/236, 15\% [11\% to 20\%]).

  abstract = {Serious concerns about research quality have catalysed a number of reform initiatives intended to improve transparency and reproducibility and thus facilitate self-correction, increase efficiency and enhance research credibility. Meta-research has evaluated the merits of some individual initiatives; however, this may not capture broader trends reflecting the cumulative contribution of these efforts. In this study, we manually examined a random sample of 250 articles in order to estimate the prevalence of a range of transparency and reproducibility-related indicators in the social sciences literature published between 2014 and 2017. Few articles indicated availability of materials (16/151, 11\% [95\% confidence interval, 7\% to 16\%]), protocols (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]), raw data (11/156, 7\% [2\% to 13\%]) or analysis scripts (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]), and no studies were pre-registered (0/156, 0\% [0\% to 1\%]). Some articles explicitly disclosed funding sources (or lack of; 74/236, 31\% [25\% to 37\%]) and some declared no conflicts of interest (36/236, 15\% [11\% to 20\%]). Replication studies were rare (2/156, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]). Few studies were included in evidence synthesis via systematic review (17/151, 11\% [7\% to 16\%]) or meta-analysis (2/151, 1\% [0\% to 3\%]).

This paper inspects this result for robustness. Theoretically, the p-value distribution should be a smooth, decreasing function, but the distribution of reported p-values shows systematically more reported p-values for .01, .02, .03, .04, and .05 than p-values reported to three decimal places, due to apparent tendencies to round p-values to two decimal places. Head et al. (2015) correctly argue that an aggregate p-value distribution could show a bump below .05 when left-skew p-hacking occurs frequently. Moreover, the elimination of p = .045 and p = .05, as done in the original paper, is debatable. Given that eliminating p = .045 is a result of the need for symmetric bins and systematically more p-values are reported to two decimal places than to three decimal places, I did not exclude p = .045 and p = .05. I conducted Fishers method .04 {$<$} p {$<$} .05 and reanalyzed the data by adjusting the bin selection to .03875 {$<$} p {$<$}= .04 versus .04875 {$<$} p {$<$}= .05. Results of the reanalysis indicate that no evidence for left-skew p-hacking remains when we look at the entire range between .04 {$<$} p {$<$} .05 or when we inspect the second-decimal. Taking into account reporting tendencies when selecting the bins to compare is especially important because this dataset does not allow for the recalculation of the p-values. Moreover, inspecting the bins that include two-decimal reported p-values potentially increases sensitivity if strategic rounding down of p-values as a form of p-hacking is widespread. Given the far-reaching implications of supposed widespread p-hacking throughout the sciences Head et al. (2015), it is important that these findings are robust to data analysis choices if the conclusion is to be considered unequivocal. Although no evidence of widespread left-skew p-hacking is found in this reanalysis, this does not mean that there is no p-hacking at all. These results nuance the conclusion by Head et al.

One type of bias, known as "p-hacking," occurs when researchers collect or select data or statistical analyses until nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.},

Although there is never any justification for the process of Sharking, we argue that Tharking can promote the effectiveness and efficiency of both scientific inquiry and cumulative knowledge creation. We argue that the discussion sections of all empirical papers should include a subsection that reports post hoc exploratory data analysis. We explain how authors, reviewers, and editors can best leverage post hoc analyses in the spirit of scientific discovery in a way that does not bias parameter estimates and recognizes the lack of definitiveness associated with any single study or any single replication. We also discuss why the failure to Thark in high-stakes contexts where data is scarce and costly may also be unethical.},

Due to an apparent increase in cases of scientific fraud and irreproducible research, some have claimed science to be in a state of crisis. A key concern in this debate has been the extent to which science is capable of self-regulation. Among various mechanisms, the peer review system in particular is considered an essential gatekeeper of both quality and sometimes even integrity in science.However, the allocation of responsibility for integrity to the peer review system is fairly recent and remains controversial. In addition, peer review currently comes in a wide variety of forms, developed in the expectation they can address specific problems and concerns in science publishing. At present, there is a clear need for a systematic analysis of peer review forms and the concerns underpinning them, especially considering a wave of experimentation fuelled by internet technologies and their promise to improve research integrity and reporting.We describe the emergence of current peer review forms by reviewing the scientific literature on peer review and by adding recent developments based on information from editors and publishers. We analyse the rationale for developing new review forms and discuss how they have been implemented in the current system. Finally, we give a systematisation of the range of discussed peer review forms. We pay detailed attention to the emergence of the expectation that peer review can maintain 'the integrity of science's published record', demonstrating that this leads to tensions in the academic debate about the responsibilities and abilities of the peer review system.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

We draw attention to three forms of cultural response by the Mapuche toward the official practices of the truth commissions from a bottom-up perspective: indifference, ambivalence and cultural resistance. We then draw attention to unofficial initiatives by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and grassroots groups that have aimed to tackle this gap in the transitional justice mechanisms by creating oppositional knowledge.

We question both justifications, highlighting potential ethical dilemmas and obstacles to constructing cumulative social science that can arise through masking. Regarding ethics, we show, on the one hand, how masking may give subjects a false sense of security because it implies a promise of confidentiality that it often cannot guarantee and, on the other hand, how naming may sometimes be what subjects want and expect. Regarding scientific tradeoffs, we argue that masking can reify ethnographic authority, exaggerate the universality of the case (e.g., “Middletown”), and inhibit replicability (or “revisits”) and sociological comparison. While some degree of masking is ethically and practically warranted in many cases and the value of disclosure varies across ethnographies, we conclude that masking should no longer be the default option that ethnographers unquestioningly choose.},

  abstract = {Confrontation is a good strategy for lowering discrimination. Given that victims who confront are evaluated negatively, the role of witnesses of discrimination is crucial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse how women who confront discrimination not directed towards them are evaluated (versus those who don’t confront), by examining the role of two factors: sexist attitudes and the characteristics of the woman. In one experimental study with a general population ( N =~657), we found that women who confront a racist comment are perceived more positively than women who do not confront. However, women who do not confront are more positively evaluated by sexist participants (vs less sexist individuals). The characteristics of the women do not affect the participants’ evaluation of them. These results show that even though women who confront may be positively evaluated in general, prejudice towards women is a key factor in the perception of women who choose not to confront.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the factors influencing whether individuals have delegative democratic attitudes (i.e. supporting strong executive power with little oversight from the legislature). Roughly up to 50\% of voters in East Asia have delegative democratic attitudes, which are known to undermine democratic governance in new democracies. Understanding delegative democratic attitudes is thus closely linked to the question of why delegative democracy persists. Our theoretical analysis suggests that delegative democratic attitudes are associated with low support for democracy, a perception of the strong influence of interest groups on policy, and trust in a national leader who can counter the power of interest groups. Using Asian Barometer Survey data from East Asian countries, 2001–2011, we confirm the hypotheses. Our findings imply that transforming a delegative democracy into a consolidated democracy requires promoting support for democracy and preventing interest group dominance over public policy.},

Findings From the 3,257 survey responses, data sharing and reuse are still increasing but not ubiquitous in any subject area and are more common among experienced researchers. Researchers with previous data reuse experience were more likely to share data than others. Types of data produced and systematic online data sharing varied substantially between subject areas. Although the use of institutional and journal-supported repositories for sharing data is increasing, personal websites are still frequently used. Combining multiple existing datasets to answer new research questions was the most common use. Proper documentation, openness and information on the usability of data continue to be important when searching for existing datasets. However, researchers in most disciplines struggled to find datasets to reuse. Researchers' feedback suggested 23 recommendations to promote data sharing and reuse, including improved data access and usability, formal data citations, new search features and cultural and policy-related disciplinary changes to increase awareness and acceptance. Originality/value This study is the first to explore data sharing and reuse practices across the full range of academic discipline types. It expands and updates previous data sharing surveys and suggests new areas of improvement in terms of policy, guidance and training programs.

We investigate whether older South Koreans, who spent much of their lives during the intense industrialization of the country, hold more positive perceptions about science than younger generations, who grew up mostly in a post-industrial era. As predicted, older individuals perceived greater contributions of science, suggesting that they held more idealized perceptions of science than younger individuals.

In this preregistered multifactorial field experiment, we randomly varied three aspects of our code request's wording in a 2x4x2 factorial design: the overall framing of our request (enhancement of social science research, response to replication crisis), the appeal why researchers should share their code (FAIR principles, academic altruism, prospect of citation, no information), and the perceived effort associated with code sharing (no code cleaning required, no information). Overall, 37.5\% of successfully contacted authors supplied their analysis code. Of our experimental treatments, only framing affected researchers' code sharing behavior, though in the opposite direction we expected: Scientists who received the negative wording alluding to the replication crisis were more likely to share their research code. Taken together, our results highlight that the availability of research code will hardly be enhanced by small-scale individual interventions but instead requires large-scale institutional norms.},

  abstract = {Many studies suggests a harsh trade off, referred to as the "the new liberal dilemma," between diversity and immigration and social capital. However, the relationship between immigrant status and trust can be better gauged by considering three interaction variables. First, informal neighbor interaction cushions the negative immigrant effect. Second, a similar role is played by fair treatment by public authorities. Third, no such cushioning interaction occurs from organizational participation. Overall, the results encourage a contingent stance about diversity and social capital. The "minority culture of mistrust" can wither away as a consequence of positive experiences of social interaction and institutional fairness. Because these have a particularly positive impact among immigrants, the trust gap between immigrants and others may, under the right circumstances, be closed at high levels of these variables.},

Como objetivo, se plantea encontrar relaciones entre determinadas instituciones informales, el nivel de emprendimiento y el progreso social. El tipo de estudio es descriptivo y exploratorio, con alcances correlacionales; donde se utiliza información de las dimensiones culturales de Hofstede Insights (2018), el Índice Global de Emprendimiento de 2018 y el Índice de Progreso Social de 2018. Los resultados muestran correlaciones que, a nivel general, revelan la tendencia de los países más desarrollados a registrar una menor distancia de poder, menor aversión a la incertidumbre y una preferencia hacia el individualismo, además de mayores niveles de emprendimiento, mayor progreso social y una mejor calidad ambiental.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that democracies are under threat around the world while the quest for strong leaders is increasing. Although the causes of these developments are complex and multifaceted, here we focus on one factor: the extent to which citizens express materialist and post-materialist concerns. We explore whether objective higher levels of democracy are differentially associated with materialist and post-materialist concerns and, in turn, whether this is related to the wish for a strong leader. Testing this hypothesis across 27 countries (N = 5,741) demonstrated a direct negative effect of democracies’ development on the wish for a strong leader. Further, multi-level mediation analysis showed that the relation between the Democracy Index and the wish for a strong leader was mediated by materialist concerns. This pattern of results suggests that lower levels of democracy are associated with enhanced concerns about basic needs and this is linked to greater support for strong leaders.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that democracies are under threat around the world while the quest for strong leaders is increasing. Although the causes of these developments are complex and multifaceted, here we focus on one factor: the extent to which citizens express materialist and post-materialist concerns. We explore whether objective higher levels of democracy are differentially associated with materialist and post-materialist concerns and, in turn, whether this is related to the wish for a strong leader. Testing this hypothesis across 27 countries (N = 5,741) demonstrated a direct negative effect of democracies' development on the wish for a strong leader. Further, multi-level mediation analysis showed that the relation between the Democracy Index and the wish for a strong leader was mediated by materialist concerns. This pattern of results suggests that lower levels of democracy are associated with enhanced concerns about basic needs and this is linked to greater support for strong leaders.},

Sin embargo dicha literatura concentra sus análisis en los atributos del entorno construido, como la densidad o la diversidad de usos de suelo, sin considerar las prácticas efectivas ni la influencia de los factores sociodemográficos en la sociabilidad barrial. El presente artículo busca profundizar en esta relación, analizando indicadores identificados por la literatura como condiciones necesarias para la vitalidad urbana, contrastándolos con variables de sociabilidad barrial como el uso del barrio, la familiaridad pública, la vecindad de la red y la sociabilidad entre vecinos, y con indicadores sociodemográficos para el Área Metropolitana de Santiago de Chile. Además de encontrar una influencia importante de los factores sociodemográficos, se identifica una relación más compleja entre la vitalidad urbana y la sociabilidad barrial, lo que revela la necesidad de repensar el concepto para la realidad de las metrópolis latinoamericanas.},

La pandemia de la COVID-19 obligó a muchos centros de investigaciones, laboratorios e investigadores a adoptar las formas propuestas por este movimiento, con el fin de responder más rápido a las demandas de la sociedad a nivel global. El impulso que se le ha dado a la Ciencia Abierta durante esta emergencia sanitaria, ha puesto sobre el tapete la discusión y la apuesta por reglamentar las normas a nivel internacional para asegurar una transición equilibrada. Es por ello que diversos organismos nacionales, como el caso de ONCTI, han adelantado iniciativas de consulta para conocer la percepción de los científicos en torno a este nuevo paradigma. Producto de estas consultas, se han generado una serie de estadísticas que permiten sondear el estado de la cuestión. En este trabajo analizamos algunas de ellas, encontrando que una parte importante de los encuestados no está familiarizada sobre la realidad de la aplicación de la Ciencia Abierta a nivel nacional, o la asocia con iniciativas y prácticas propias de la ciencia tradicional. Un ejemplo son las nociones de “transferencia de conocimiento hacia las comunidades” o “divulgación de la ciencia”, que implican una visión ofertista y lineal de la misma. Es importante considerar estas asociaciones al momento de formular una política de Ciencia Abierta a nivel nacional.},

Recent debates about transparency raise important questions about which of these research communities will be accredited within the discipline, whose values, norms, and methods of knowledge production will gain ascendency and whose will be marginalized. Although the language of "transparency" makes it appear that these debates are apolitical, simply elaborating standards that all political scientists share, the intensity and content of recent contestations about DA-RT, JETS, and QTD attest to the profoundly political nature of these methodological discussions. This report traces the epistemological and ontological assumptions that have shaped diverse research communities within the discipline, situating "transparency" in relation to classical (Aristotelian), modern (Baconian) and twentieth-century (positivist, critical rationalist, and postpositivist) versions of empiricism. It shows how recent discussions of transparency accredit certain empirical approaches by collapsing the scope of empirical investigation and the parameters of the knowable.

Ante el incremento de la matrícula femenina y la visibilización y demandas sociales respecto de las desigualdades de género, nos preguntamos, de qué manera las instituciones de ETP favorecen el reconocimiento y la participación con miras a la justicia social. Este trabajo analiza discursos sobre las desigualdades entre varones y mujeres (en interseccionalidad con otras) que circulan en 12 instituciones de educación técnico profesional en dos provincias argentinas (Neuquén y Mendoza), y sobre los dispositivos de acompañamiento a la escolaridad y articulación con el trabajo que allí se construyen. Desplegamos un diseño de investigación comparativo basado en la triangulación de fuentes secundarias y el uso de técnicas cualitativas y cuantitativas para la producción de datos primarios. Como estrategia de análisis optamos por el Análisis Crítico del Discurso. Encontramos tres tipos de discursos que organizan los modos de mirar, entender y actuar en relación a ser varón o mujer que se articulan con otras dimensiones con un sentido de justicia social particular. Definimos a estos discursos como: Naturalización de jerarquías; Visibilización de jerarquías; Visibilización de jerarquías y acciones para la transformación. Si bien estos discursos conviven en todas las instituciones, identificamos predominancia de algunos en cada una de ellas, así como en los territorios en que se asientan. Finalmente presentamos un caso de una institución en el que analizamos el entramado discursivo.},

However, much of the research in psychology relies on the (re-)analysis of preexisting data. Importantly, this type of studies is different from original studies as researchers cannot change major aspects of the study (e.g., experimental manipulations, sample size). Here, we provide arguments as to why it is useful to preregister analyses of preexisting data, discuss practical considerations, consider potential concerns, and introduce a preregistration template tailored for studies focused on the analyses of preexisting data. We argue that the preregistration of hypotheses and data-analyses for analyses of preexisting data is an important step towards more transparent psychological research.},

It is shown that for now only the practices of implementing the lower “procedural” aspect of Open Science, in particular the development of open access to data and information, are in the focus of attention at both national and institutional levels, while the support for the values of democracy and academic freedom mostly remains a declaration. Open Science is argued to be not just the promotion of open access and the building of the corresponding infrastructure, but the whole paradigm of openness and democratization of research practices, including their decentralization and the abandonment of the externally imposed orientation on quantitative and formal indicators of the research effectiveness. It is found to be especially difficult to implement the values of academic freedom and democracy declared in normative documents and development strategies into everyday research practice considering the centralized traditions of management peculiar to many countries of the world, including Ukraine and China. Still, some of the practices that are being more or less successfully realized in China and other countries of the Southeast Asian region, which are at approximately the same stage of movement from excessive centralization of the higher education system to its democratization, are argued to be useful as examples for Ukraine.}

  abstract = {Tradicionalmente las tendencias y partidos de izquierda se han asociado a un rol más activo del Estado en temas de redistribución. Este trabajo pretende ahondar en este punto, analizando en qué medida la composición de los parlamentos en términos de izquierda-derecha (balance legislativo) se relaciona con mayores o menores preferen- cias por redistribución por parte de la población. Los resultados del estudio demues- tran, primero, que a mayor tendencia hacia la izquierda en los aparatos legislativos, las preferencias redistributivas tienden a ser menores. En segundo lugar, la mayor adhe- sión al sistema polı́tico se asocia a un mayor grado de acuerdo con la reasignación de recursos, y por último, en paı́ses con alto número de polı́ticos de izquierda en el con- greso el efecto de la adhesión al sistema polı́tico es más grande y positivo respecto a la redistribución.

En este artículo estudiamos el uso que se hace de Sci-Hub en Argentina a partir de un análisis cuantitativo de las estadísticas de descargas disponibles hasta 2017. Detectamos patrones de uso generales, editoriales y temáticos de los documentos e indagamos aspectos comunes y diferenciadores con respecto al uso mundial y otros países de América Latina. Asimismo, determinamos, a partir de distintas muestras, si los artículos accedidos además están disponibles en acceso abierto y/o su acceso es posible a través de las suscripciones pagadas por el estado nacional a través de la Biblioteca Electrónica de Ciencia y Tecnología (BECyT). Encontramos que las descargas realizadas desde Argentina representan poco más del 1\% de las registradas a nivel mundial, que existe una gran dispersión de títulos solicitados y que hay un aumento significativo en el uso respecto a los mismos períodos de 2015 y 2016. Con las distintas muestras pudimos observar que se están descargando mayormente artículos de acceso restringido publicados por las empresas editoriales que manejan el sector como oligopolio, en revistas indexadas en la llamada “corriente principal” y que corresponden al área de la medicina (oncología, pediatría y medicina cardiovascular). También, detectamos un número significativo de descargas de artículos que ya estaban disponibles en acceso abierto, evidenciando un posible desconocimiento de estos recursos y calculamos un incremento importante respecto al uso de BECyT. Concluimos que las descargas desde Argentina tienen patrones similares al resto del mundo y que el aumento de su uso muestra que un cambio más radical para garantizar el derecho de acceso a la información es necesario.

  abstract = {The Youth Development Study was initiated to address the developmental and achievement-related consequences of employment during the adolescent years. Data collection began in the 1987-88 academic year with a panel of teenagers (G2) randomly selected from a list of 9th graders attending the St. Paul (Minnesota) Public Schools. G2 respondents have filled out surveys near-annually (exceptions are 1996, 2001, 2006, 2008, and 2010), first administered in their high school classrooms (Waves 1 through 4) and subsequently by mail, through 2011 (Wave 19), when the respondents were 37 and 38 years old. The G2 surveys included detailed questions about students' work and volunteer experiences, as well as experiences in their family, school, and peer group, with an emphasis on the ways that working affected other life domains. Shorter surveys containing many of the same topics were administered to students in 1992, 1993, and 1994, and included questions about current family and living arrangements. In 1995, a full survey was administered covering the wide range of topics included in the previous surveys as well as information on career plans and life events that had occurred in the past five years. G2 Waves 9 through 15 (1997-2004) included many of the same questions contained in 1992-1994 surveys with addition sections that focused on the respondents' school and work experiences, family relationships such as marital status and children, education level and career preparation, how the respondent learned of his or her job and his or her level of satisfaction with it, and economic support questions including income level and living expenses. The parents of the G2 cohort (G1) were surveyed in the first and fourth waves of the study, when their G2 children were in the first year of high school and four years later. The G1 surveys obtained information about socioeconomic background as well as attitudes toward teenage employment, their own employment as teenagers, their experiences in their current employment, and educational expectations for their children. In 2008, the children of G2 who were age 11 and older were recruited (G3). The first data collection (a mailed survey) from G3 occurred in 2009, followed by the second in 2010, and the third in 2011, again including those children who turned 11, as well as older children who had not joined the study previously. The topics covered by the G3 surveys are very similar to the G2 topics listed above. Demographic variables include child and parent sex, age, race, education level, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, marital status, employment status, income, language used at home, and whether respondents were born in the United States, as well as the sex and age of all household members.},

  abstract = {Based on an ethnographic research on early mothering with a small and heterogeneous group of women living in different areas of Santiago, Chile – and a follow-up study six years later – in this article we look closely at how mothering takes place through a sense of optimism while living in a hostile world, contrasting our findings with similar research in northern countries. Rather than waiting for opportunities to present themselves, women’s sense of optimism is based on their own difficult experiences of learning to cope in a hostile world, and how this requires organizing their children’s education to face challenges beyond their immediate family circle. We claim the existence of hyper-agentic motherhood – one that articulates traditional maternalism, increasing societal demands on parenting and the specific take on individuation detached from institutions in neoliberal Chile. Mothering through optimism in a hostile world questions the possibility to import classed parenting models. We identify a resonance with Adrie Kusserow’s description of hard individualism in which children are taught how to navigate the hostile world in the search for success, but with the difference that children in this context are brought up with the idea that mothers will be there for them in the long run, regardless of what actually takes place. This longitudinal study of parenting provides information on the usually silent processes of subjectification and emergent values that can be overlooked in times of social transformation.},

Using a survey research design, we collected data from academics and other researchers in the humanities, arts and social sciences (HASS) at a university in Australia. We looked at factors influencing choice of publishers and journal outlets, as well as the use of social media and nontraditional channels for scholarly communication. We used an online questionnaire to collect data and used descriptive statistics to analyse the data. Our findings suggest that researchers are highly influenced by traditional measures of quality, such as journal impact factor, and are less concerned with making their work more findable and promoting it through social media. This highlights a disconnect between researchers' desired outcomes and the efforts that they put in toward the same. Our findings also suggest that institutional policies have the potential to increase OA awareness and adoption. This study contributes to the growing literature on scholarly communication by offering evidence from the HASS field, where limited studies have been conducted. Based on the findings, we recommend that academic librarians engage with faculty through outreach and workshops to change perceptions of OA and the institutional repository.}

  abstract = {Objectives: Whilst the need for Open Research practices is well documented, there remains a lack of validated questionnaires to assess their prevalence. This study validated the Brief Open Research Survey (BORS) to measure Open Research awareness and uptake.Methods: The survey was developed in six steps: 1) a scoping exercise collated previous questionnaires on Open Research, 2) a brief (\&lt;5 minutes) questionnaire was developed, 3) peer-reviewed, 4) piloted, 5) revised, and 6) the final questionnaire was distributed across UK Reproducibility Network Local Networks.Results: Respondents (n = 1,274) reported being most aware of Open Access Publications (94.1\%), Preprints (85.35\%), and Open Data (83.4\%) and least aware of Registered Reports (38.4\%), Study Preregistration (50.8\%) and Research Co-production (53.7\%). They reported having mostly used Open Access Publications (77.8\%), Preprints (56.5\%) and Open Data (52.5\%) and having least used Registered Reports (8.7\%), Replication Studies (16.3\%), and Study Preregistration (25.3\%). Incentives (51\%), dedicated funding (46.2\%), and recognition in promotion and recruitment criteria (39.6\%) were perceived to support the use of Open Research. Conclusion: We validated the Brief Open Research Survey that can be used to assess prevalence of Open Research practices and track uptake overtime.}

  abstract = {As qualitative research becomes increasingly recognized and valued, it is imperative that it is conducted in a rigorous and methodical manner to yield meaningful and useful results. To be accepted as trustworthy, qualitative researchers must demonstrate that data analysis has been conducted in a precise, consistent, and exhaustive manner through recording, systematizing, and disclosing the methods of analysis with enough detail to enable the reader to determine whether the process is credible. Although there are numerous examples of how to conduct qualitative research, few sophisticated tools are available to researchers for conducting a rigorous and relevant thematic analysis. The purpose of this article is to guide researchers using thematic analysis as a research method. We offer personal insights and practical examples, while exploring issues of rigor and trustworthiness. The process of conducting a thematic analysis is illustrated through the presentation of an auditable decision trail, guiding interpreting and representing textual data. We detail our step-by-step approach to exploring the effectiveness of strategic clinical networks in Alberta, Canada, in our mixed methods case study. This article contributes a purposeful approach to thematic analysis in order to systematize and increase the traceability and verification of the analysis.},

  abstract = {Open science can provide researchers diverse opportunities to collaborate, disseminate their research results, generate important impacts in the scientific community, and engage in effective and efficient science for the benefit of society. This study seeks to analyse and evaluate researchers' knowledge of open science in Colombia using a survey to determine adequate instruments with which to improve research in the framework of open science. The aim of the study is to determine researchers' current awareness of open science by considering demographic characteristics to analyse their attitudes, values, and information habits as well as the levels of institutionalism and social appropriation of open science. A representative sample of Colombian researchers was selected from the National Research System. An anonymous online survey consisting of 34 questions was sent to all professors and researchers at Colombian universities and research institutes.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Introduction               Public opinion studies have traditionally relied on survey analyses. However, a qualitative approach is needed to address opinion formation's multidimensional and contextual nature. In this study, we argue that focus groups are a technique that addresses these unique challenges.                                         Methods               We test this argument by looking at the case of Chile, a country marked by a streak of eight elections in three years, including two national referendums for a constitutional proposal. In this politically polarized setting, and over the course of the latter election year, we conducted 10 focus groups comprising a diverse sample in terms of gender, age, socioeconomic status, and occupation. As participants shared news diets, political views, and values, data suggest a tendency to independently verify information regardless of the source, and highly influenced by their close ones.                                         Results               From a methodological perspective, our findings show that focus groups enable the assessment of the context‐situated opinion formation process, reveal emerging themes, and promote open discussion. These results also reflect the multifaceted nature of public opinion formation in a dynamic media landscape and can inform other countries undergoing a crisis of institutional legitimacy.},

  abstract = {In several metropolises of the so-called Global South, the claim for the right to live in the city has resulted in widespread processes of “autoconstruction”, a concept that alludes to a mode of producing the urban peripheries in which poor residents are the main agents of urbanization. Autoconstruction has made possible the emergence of new forms of citizenship in which the urban poor have generated novel spaces for civic participation through which they have tur-ned into legitimate rights-bearers. What happens, however, when the agents of autoconstruc-tion are immigrants demanding not only the right to housing, but also their recognition as subjects of rights in a nation-state that does not consider them citizens? This article discusses that question by ethnographically examining the case of Nueva Esperanza squatter settlement, an autoconstructed neighborhood in Colina, Santiago in which most of its residents are foreigners. We conclude that, to constitute themselves as citizens, immigrants formulate an “urban” type of citizenship in which the act of residing in the city turn them into rights-bearers. In such a process, these residents build ethical and political narratives through which they make sense of their desires for incorporation and belonging to the national political community.           ,              En diversas metrópolis del llamado Sur global, el reclamo por el derecho a habitar en la ciudad ha desembocado en extensos procesos de “autoconstrucción”, concepto que alude a un modo de edificar las periferias urbanas en el que los habitantes populares son los principales agentes de la urbanización. La autoconstrucción ha posibilitado la irrupción de nuevas formas de ciudadanía en las cuales los pobres han generado nuevos espacios de participación cívica que los han convertido en legítimos portadores de derechos. ¿Qué ocurre, sin embargo, cuando los agentes de la autoconstrucción son inmigrantes demandando no solo el derecho a la vivienda, sino también su reconocimiento como sujetos de derechos en un Estado-nación que no los considera ciudadanos? Este artículo discute dicha pregunta examinando etnográficamente el caso del campamento Nueva Esperanza, asentamiento autoconstruido por inmigrantes de origen latinoamericano en la comuna de Colina, Santiago. Concluimos que, para constituirse como ciudadanos, los extranjeros formulan un tipo “urbano” de ciudadanía, en donde el acto de residir en la ciudad los convierte en legítimos portadores de derechos. En dicho proceso, estos residentes construyen narrativas éticas y políticas a través de las cuales significan sus deseos de incorporación y pertenencia a la comunidad política nacional.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes individuation itineraries by considering the forms of participation and reflexivity of young people who live in low-income neighborhoods in three metropolitan areas: Buenos Aires/Argentina, Porto Alegre/Brazil, and Santiago/Chile. For this, this study articulated the results of several empirical studies conducted from 2013 to 2019 with the conceptual tools in Danilo Martuccelli’s sociology of the individual, especially its notions of tests, supports, and social textures. This research first addresses theoretical frameworks to implement its problem and methodological strategies to build and analyze youth’s narratives. Then, it interpreted its data corpus around two central axes: a) lowincome territories, actors, and interworlds and b) young people, social participation, and reflexivities. Young people face a plurality of material and symbolic coercions in several low-income territories. However, these territories also create collective spaces in which youths establish personal and group identifications as they discover or generate sports, artistic-political, and educational proposals, which create intergenerational bonds, recover ancestral knowledge, and build referential and reflective landmarks, transforming territorialities into supports and a sign of recognition. Thus, studying youth narratives offers a privileged tool to analyze Latin American low-income agencies and individualities.},

Los datos utilizados provienen del Estudio Nacional sobre el Conflicto y la Cohesión Social en Chile, realizado por el Centro de Estudios del Conflicto y la Cohesión Social (COES) en 2014.

Se destaca la importancia de considerar la educación y los ingresos como factores que pueden influir en las percepciones de deprivación relativa y, por ende, en la motivación para la acción política. Los resultados preliminares sugieren que las percepciones sobre la legitimidad del sistema económico juegan un papel significativo en el comportamiento político de los individuos, especialmente en un contexto de crisis de representatividad y distanciamiento entre la política partidista y la ciudadanía común. Se plantea la necesidad de profundizar en la comprensión de estos mecanismos para abordar los desafíos actuales en materia de participación política y legitimidad institucional en Chile.},

Se destaca la importancia de considerar la educación y los ingresos como factores que pueden influir en las percepciones de deprivación relativa y, por ende, en la motivación para la acción política. Los resultados preliminares sugieren que las percepciones sobre la legitimidad del sistema económico juegan un papel significativo en el comportamiento político de los individuos, especialmente en un contexto de crisis de representatividad y distanciamiento entre la política partidista y la ciudadanía común.

A través de un enfoque sociológico, se analiza cómo las opiniones sobre la distribución de recompensas en la sociedad influyen en las acciones políticas de los ciudadanos.

Evidence of the extent of these issues is urgently needed to inform actions for reform, however. We analyse current practices as revealed by documentation on institutional review, promotion and tenure processes in seven countries (Austria, Brazil, Germany, India, Portugal, United Kingdom and United States of America). Through systematic coding and analysis of 143 RPT policy documents from 107 institutions for the prevalence of 17 criteria (including those related to qualitative or quantitative assessment of research, service to the institution or profession, and open and responsible research practices), we compare assessment practices across a range of international institutions to significantly broaden this evidence-base. Although prevalence of indicators varies considerably between countries, overall we find that currently open and responsible research practices are minimally rewarded and problematic practices of quantification continue to dominate.}

In this article, we summarize ongoing debates about open data from qualitative perspectives, and through a content analysis of 261 journals we establish the state of current journal policies for open data in the domain of social psychology. We critically discuss how current common expectations for open data may not be adequate for establishing qualitative rigour, can introduce ethical challenges, and may place those who wish to use qualitative approaches at a disadvantage in peer review and publication processes. We advise that future open data guidelines should aim to reflect the nuance of arguments surrounding data sharing in qualitative research, and move away from a universal “one-size-fits-all” approach to data sharing. This article outlines the past, present, and the potential future of open data guidelines in social-psychological journals.

By replicating the procedures of previous research, the present study aimed at describing the use of QRPs among Brazilian psychological researchers and to make an international comparison with previous studies in other countries—the US and Italy. Two hundred and thirty-two Brazilian researchers in the field of psychology answered questions related to 10 different QRPs. Brazilian researchers indicated a lower tendency to engage in two QRPs (failing to report all of a study's dependent measures; deciding whether to collect more data after looking to see whether the results were significant) when compared to their Italian and North American counterparts, but indicated a higher tendency to engage in two other QRPs (selectively reporting studies that “worked”; not reporting all of a study's conditions). Most of the sample did not admit integrity conflicts in their own research but indicated that others have integrity problems, as observed in previous studies. Those discrepancies could be attributed to contextual and systemic factors regarding different publication demands among the different nations. Further studies should focus on identifying the antecedents of QRPs.},

  abstract = {Improving the usability of psychological research has been encouraged through practices such as prospectively registering research plans. Registering research aligns with the open-science movement, as the registration of research protocols in publicly accessible domains can result in reduced research waste and increased study transparency. In medicine and psychology, two different terms, registration and preregistration, have been used to refer to study registration, but applying inconsistent terminology to represent one concept can complicate both educational outreach and epidemiological investigation. Consistently using one term across disciplines to refer to the concept of study registration may improve the understanding and uptake of this practice, thereby supporting the movement toward improving the reliability and reproducibility of research through study registration. We recommend encouraging use of the original term, registration, given its widespread and long-standing use, including in national registries.},

  abstract = {Gelman and Loken (2013, 2014) proposed that when researchers base their statistical analyses on the idiosyncratic characteristics of a specific sample (e.g., a nonlinear transformation of a variable because it is skewed), they open up alternative analysis paths in potential replications of their study that are based on different samples (i.e., no transformation of the variable because it is not skewed). These alternative analysis paths count as additional (multiple) tests and, consequently, they increase the probability of making a Type I error during hypothesis testing. The present article considers this forking paths problem and evaluates four potential solutions that might be used in psychology and other fields: (a) adjusting the prespecified alpha level, (b) preregistration, (c) sensitivity analyses, and (d) abandoning the Neyman-Pearson approach. It is concluded that although preregistration and sensitivity analyses are effective solutions to p-hacking, they are ineffective against result-neutral forking paths, such as those caused by transforming data. Conversely, although adjusting the alpha level cannot address p-hacking, it can be effective for result-neutral forking paths. Finally, abandoning the Neyman-Pearson approach represents a further solution to the forking paths problem.},

The Reproducibility Project documents the degree to which the findings from mainstream psychological studies are reproduced. Drawing on intersectionality theory, we question the value of reproducing findings while ignoring who is represented, intersecting social and group identities, sociohistorical context, and the power and privilege that likely influence participants' responses in psychology experiments. To critically examine the Reproducibility Project in psychology, we analyzed the 100 replication reports produced between 2011 and 2014 (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). We developed an intersectional analytic framework to investigate (a) representation, (b) whether demographic and identity factors were considered through a multidimensional or intersectional lens, (c) explanations of non-replication, and (d) whether socio-cultural context was considered. Results show that reports predominantly include WEIRD samples (people from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries). Context and identity were rarely considered, even when study design relied on these factors, and intersectional identities and structures (considering power, structural issues, discrimination, and historical context) were absent from nearly all reports.

  abstract = {Varios autores han reconocido la importancia estratégica de la educación cívica en el fortalecimiento de las democracias modernas y la centralidad de la institución escolar como órgano fundamental en el proceso de alfabetización cívica y política de las nuevas generaciones. Generalmente, el acento se ha puesto o en las características de un currículo democrático; o en el modelaje de didácticas de aula que favorecerían la formación de disposiciones pro-cívicas, pero poco se ha dicho sobre si la cultura de la escuela (esto es, sus prácticas y rutinas institucionales) tendría algún relación con el mejoramiento de las capacidades y destrezas cívicas de los estudiantes. Asimismo, nuevas conceptualizaciones de liderazgo escolar, como el liderazgo distribuido, han desafiado la visión gerencialista de la gestión escolar, lo que invita a evaluar su eficacia en la mejora de las habilidades cívicas de los estudiantes. El liderazgo distribuido supone el ejercicio de un estilo más descentralizado de gobierno institucional, en donde profesores destacados y otros miembros relevantes de la comunidad escolar asumen un rol más protagónico en la toma de decisiones sobre temas relativos a la dirección de la escuela. Asimismo, uno de los grandes retos que, en la actualidad, enfrentan las instituciones de educación escolar, es el de crear estrategias útiles para que los docentes se comprometan con los objetivos organizacionales y se integren activamente en los proyectos institucionales en el largo plazo. A partir de los datos informados por el Estudio Internacional de Educación Cívica y Formación Ciudadana (2009) para Chile, busca evaluar el rol del liderazgo distribuido de los directores y del compromiso organizacional docente de los profesores en la mejora de las habilidades cívicas de los estudiantes, considerando sus expresiones tanto manifiestas (medibles y observables) como latentes (potencialmente traducibles en formas manifiestas). Los resultados, obtenidos a partir de la estimación de modelos multinivel, exhiben que ni el compromiso organizacional docente ni el liderazgo distribuido se asocian con mayores expectativas de participación política, ni latente ni manifiesta. Si bien los parámetros son positivos, la relación no es estadísticamente significativa a niveles convencionales. Sin embargo, la participación política latente y manifiesta sí es significativa y positiva para las variables individuales de participación y valoración del involucramiento en la toma de decisiones de la escuela, lo que presta apoyo empírico a la hipótesis de que los estudiantes, más que aprender implícitamente sobre ciudadanía a partir de rutinas organizacionales de mayor horizontalidad, aprenden en el marco de un ejercicio cotidiano y sistemático de ciudadanía al interior de sus contextos socializantes. La socialización política, por ende, se constituye en un proceso de práctica individual de la democracia y no por asociación con figuras de autoridad. La investigación, asimismo, reafirma el núcleo conceptual presente en el relato sobre ciudadanía adscrito a las reformas curriculares sancionadas en la década del 2000 en Chile, en el sentido de un sello en la educación ciudadana como parte integral del proceso formativo de la escuela, que excede un aprendizaje meramente cognitivo y que se proyecta y actualiza en los espacios institucionales de deliberación y participación política.

A silver standard corpus, created by a distant and weak supervision approach, and a gold standard corpus, created by manual annotation, were used to train an LSTM based neural network to identify software mentions in scientific articles. The model achieves a recognition rate of .82 F-score in exact matches. As a result, we identified more than 133,000 software mentions. For entity disambiguation, we used the public domain knowledge base DBpedia. Furthermore, we linked the entities of the knowledge graph to other knowledge bases such as the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph, the Software Ontology, and Wikidata. Finally, we illustrate, how SoftwareKG can be used to assess the role of software in the social sciences.},

  abstract = {En la Educación Técnica Profesional (ETP) secundaria existe una fuerte segmentación por género entre áreas formativas asociadas a distintos estatus y retribuciones salariales. En particular, las mujeres son minoría en establecimientos que imparten especialidades asociadas a los sectores de Electricidad, Metalmecánica y Construcción, donde las estructuras y culturas refuerzan la imagen masculina de las profesiones. A partir de 19 entrevistas realizadas en 6 establecimientos de 3 regiones de Chile, este artículo analiza los discursos de docentes directivos y de aula que emergen en estos entornos. Se identifican tres tipos de discursos según la aproximación al género de los estudiantes: (1) el género invisibilizado, al considerarse inadecuada esta categoría para abordar problemáticas en el espacio escolar; (2) el género de posiciones binarias, que naturaliza y elogia roles tradicionales diferenciados por el sexo biológico; y (3) el género visibilizado en el afuera, que reconoce desigualdades entre hombres y mujeres, pero situándolas en el mercado laboral. Se concluye que las tres posiciones discursivas, al invisibilizar, normalizar o situar fuera del espacio escolar las inequidades de género desestiman posiciones de responsabilidad y agencia en los docentes que transformen culturas y estructuras que imperan en los centros escolares y que perpetúan la división sexual del trabajo.},

  abstract = {En la Educación Técnica Profesional (ETP) secundaria existe una fuerte segmentación por género entre áreas formativas asociadas a distintos estatus y retribuciones salariales. En particular, las mujeres son minoría en establecimientos que imparten especialidades asociadas a los sectores de Electricidad, Metalmecánica y Construcción, donde las estructuras y culturas refuerzan la imagen masculina de las profesiones. A partir de 19 entrevistas realizadas en 6 establecimientos de 3 regiones de Chile, este artículo analiza los discursos de docentes directivos y de aula que emergen en estos entornos. Se identifican tres tipos de discursos según la aproximación al género de los estudiantes: (1) el género invisibilizado, al considerarse inadecuada esta categoría para abordar problemáticas en el espacio escolar; (2) el género de posiciones binarias, que naturaliza y elogia roles tradicionales diferenciados por el sexo biológico; y (3) el género visibilizado en el afuera, que reconoce desigualdades entre hombres y mujeres, pero situándolas en el mercado laboral.

  abstract = {Because scientists tend to report only studies (publication bias) or analyses (p-hacking) that “work,” readers must ask, “Are these effects true, or do they merely reflect selective reporting?” We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p values for a set of studies (ps p-curves—containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values—only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.

We found correlational (Studies 1 and 2) and experimental (Studies 3a and 3b) evidence for our prediction that higher inequality enhances the wish for a strong leader.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that economic inequality is associated with a wish for a strong leader in a study involving 28 countries from five continents (Study 1, N = 6,112), a study involving an Australian community sample (Study 2, N = 515), and two experiments (Study 3a, N = 96; Study 3b, N = 296). We found correlational (Studies 1 and 2) and experimental (Studies 3a and 3b) evidence for our prediction that higher inequality enhances the wish for a strong leader. We also found that this relationship is mediated by perceptions of anomie, except in the case of objective inequality in Study 1. This suggests that societal inequality enhances the perception that society is breaking down (anomie) and that a strong leader is needed to restore order (even when that leader is willing to challenge democratic values).},

Researchers may engage in positionality and reflexivity in a variety of ways, and transparently sharing these steps allows readers to draw their own informed conclusions about the results and study as a whole. Imposing a limited, quantitatively-informed set of standards on all research can cause harm to researchers and the communities they work with if researchers are not careful in considering the impact of such standards.

  abstract = {The last decade has seen two significant phenomena emerge in research communication: the rise of open access (OA) publishing, and the easy availability of evidence of online sharing in the form of altmetrics. There has been limited examination of the effect of OA on online sharing for journal articles, and little for books. This paper examines the altmetrics of a set of 32,222 books (of which 5\% are OA) and a set of 220,527 chapters (of which 7\% are OA) indexed by the scholarly database Dimensions in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Both OA books and chapters have significantly higher use on social networks, higher coverage in the mass media and blogs, and evidence of higher rates of social impact in policy documents. OA chapters have higher rates of coverage on Wikipedia than their non-OA equivalents, and are more likely to be shared on Mendeley.

There has been limited examination of the effect of OA on online sharing for journal articles, and little for books. This paper examines the altmetrics of a set of 32,222 books (of which 5\% are OA) and a set of 220,527 chapters (of which 7\% are OA) indexed by the scholarly database Dimensions in the Social Sciences and Humanities. Both OA books and chapters have significantly higher use on social networks, higher coverage in the mass media and blogs, and evidence of higher rates of social impact in policy documents. OA chapters have higher rates of coverage on Wikipedia than their non-OA equivalents, and are more likely to be shared on Mendeley.

This study also examines the association between political placement and welfare attitudes. Data from the European Social Survey (N = 37,743 in 20 countries) are analyzed using a two-level regression analysis. The findings indicate that individualism at the cultural culture is a significant factor in terms of individuals’ attitudes to welfare, in that the higher the level of individualism, the lesser the likelihood that the state’s welfare responsibility is supported. On the other hand, citizens’ attitudes towards state responsibility for welfare are associated with the political placement of those citizens. Politically, people leaning to the right have a lower degree of interest in the state’s welfare responsibility. Furthermore, the degree of individualism modifies the association at the individual level of political placement and welfare attitudes. There is a greater attitudinal difference between the supporters of right-wing and left-wing political views in individualistic countries than in collectivist countries. From a social policy perspective, this study emphasizes the association of individualism and welfare attitudes. The results suggest that social policy is based more on national cultural values than one might assume.},

  abstract = {La desigualdad es señalada como uno de los principales riesgos para la estabilidad de las democracias. Chile es un caso peculiar, ya que a pesar de ser uno de los países con mayores niveles de desigualdad (índice GINI, por ejemplo) no presenta gran inestabilidad. En este contexto, se hace relevante estudiar los mecanismos a nivel psicológico que permitirían justificar la desigualdad de las sociedades, siendo la meritocracia una de las principales estrategias de las sociedades democráticas en la legitimación de las desigualdades sociales. El presente estudio de carácter cuantitativo no experimental, transversal y correlacional, propone medir la meritocracia diferenciando dos dimensiones: percepción y creencia meritocrática, e identificar en qué grado elementos de estatus individual (subjetivo, ingreso per cápita familiar y nivel educacional) se relacionan con cada dimensión, y la relación de ambas dimensiones con la percepción de la desigualdad salarial. Se utilizaron los datos del proyecto Fondecyt “Desigualdad, Justicia Social y Participación Ciudadana”, constituidos por 1.245 casos obtenidos mediante un muestreo probabilístico estratificado en 4 etapas (comunas, manzanas, vivienda, habitante). El modelo de medición de la meritocracia, así como la relación de ésta con los elementos individuales de estatus y desigualdad, fueron estimados mediante ecuaciones estructurales. Los resultados del estudio señalan que existe un funcionamiento diferenciado entre percepción y creencia en la meritocracia, que implica que estos debiesen distinguirse cada vez que se mida la meritocracia. Además, se observa que percepción y creencia meritocrática se asocian de forma distinta a los elementos individuales considerados en el modelo de este estudio: la percepción se encuentra influida por el estatus subjetivo y por el nivel educacional (de forma inversa), mientras que la creencia no se asocia a los elementos considerados en el modelo. Respecto de la desigualdad, se observa que la meritocracia funcionaria como una estrategia legitimadora, por un lado, al asociarse a la percepción de menores niveles de desigualdad (percepción) y, por otro, a desear mayores brechas salariales entre ocupaciones de alto y bajo estatus (creencia).},

This has come about in a context of extreme fear of crime and mistrust of the institutions in charge of security. The fact that the discourse of security coproduction is interwoven with the individuation and privatization that characterize Chilean society calls for a review of the agenda of citizen participation in security issues.  Un estudio de las implicaciones de la política de coproducción de seguridad implementada por los gobiernos postdictadura de Chile muestra que el llamado a la participación ciudadana en provisión de seguridad ha resultado en prácticas individuales de defensa y protección del hogar más que en el desarrollo de programas asociativos promovidos por el estado. Esto ha ocurrido en un contexto de miedo extremo al crimen y desconfianza de las instituciones a cargo de la seguridad. El hecho de que el discurso de la coproducción de seguridad esté entrelazado con la individuación y la privatización que caracteriza a la sociedad chilena requiere una revisión de la agenda de participación ciudadana en temas de seguridad.},

Los resultados dan cuenta que la mayoría de los artículos revisados no declaran abiertamente el paradigma desde el cual se posicionan, además se observa una multiplicidad de técnicas conversacionales, en las cuales destaca el uso de entrevistas. Se concluye que la adscripción a algún paradigma no es un asunto determinante a la hora de informar resultados, por cuanto estos forman parte de estudios más amplios o, por su estructura son más pragmáticos. Además, entre quienes declaran paradigmas de investigación, predomina una posición constructivista. Por otro lado, el uso de técnicas conversacionales varía en función de los objetivos de cada investigación, presentándose en un amplio espectro, predomina el uso de entrevistas, y los grupos de discusión y grupos focales son usados indistintamente.}

  abstract = {Internships are essential for student trajectories of Vocational-Technical Education (VTE), as they allow the reinforcement of learning achieved in the classroom and provide knowledge and vocational maturity that can only be completed in the labor context. This article shows the difficulties that female students face in male-dominated Vocational-Technical Education (VTE) programs during their experiences of internship in the workplace. To do this, based on 29 interviews of female graduates from these programs, we analyze the process of doing and undoing gender, and how women negotiate their gender when facing discrimination in the companies that host them as practitioners. The findings reveal women´s adjustment strategies that combine resistance and acceptance in a context where companies do not adjust their dynamics and practices to integrate them. Instead, women adapt their behaviors to the cultural norms of implicit and explicit sexism in the learning workplaces. Thus, the arrival of all female students to the companies is an opening act, which requires them to conquer their own space configured from exceptionality. This situation reduces the potential of apprenticeships to drive successful transitions to the labor market.},

To assess whether similar distortions occur in communication science, we extracted 5,834 test statistics from 693 recent communication science ISI papers, and assessed prevalence of p-values (1) misreported, and (2) just below .05. Results show 8.8\% of p-values were misreported (74.5\% too low). 1.3\% of p-values were critically misreported, stating p {$<$} .05 while in fact p {$>$} .05 (88.3\%) or vice versa (11.7\%). Analyzing p-value frequencies just below .05 using a novel method did not unequivocally demonstrate “p-hacking”—excess p-values could be alternatively explained by (severe) publication bias. Results for 19,830 p-values from social psychology were strikingly similar. We conclude that publication bias, publication pressure, and verification bias distort the communication science knowledge base, and suggest solutions to this problem.}

Researchers themselves may not be immune to these fallacies and may unwittingly adjust their statistical analysis to produce an outcome that is more pleasant or better in line with prior expectations. To shield researchers from the impact of cognitive fallacies, several methodologists are now advocating preregistration-that is, the creation of a detailed analysis plan before data collection or data analysis. One may argue, however, that preregistration is out of touch with academic reality, hampering creativity and impeding scientific progress. We provide a historical overview to show that the interplay between creativity and verification has shaped theories of scientific inquiry throughout the centuries; in the currently dominant theory, creativity and verification operate in succession and enhance one another's effectiveness. From this perspective, the use of preregistration to safeguard the verification stage will help rather than hinder the generation of fruitful new ideas.},

Employing the system GMM dynamic panel data estimator, which addresses endogeneity concerns by means of internal instruments, I find that the levels of education, government size, globalisation, and economic development have significantly positive effects on most dimensions of a country’s social cohesion. In contrast, inflation, corruption and income inequality are detrimental to social cohesion.},

  abstract = {The deleterious effects of joint bias in favor of statistical inference and against replication are becoming well known. The acceptance of numerous Type I errors into the literature is by far the most serious of these. Data on the contents of three major journals support the contention that a joint bias for statistical significance tests, for rejections, and against replication exists in modern sociology. This finding replicates that of Sterling (1959) for psychology. A speculative analysis of the dynamics of publication decisions suggests that a compact format for reporting replications might make their publication more attractive to editors, and thus increase their frequency in the literature. A possible format for briefly reporting replication studies is suggested.},

In the current research, we tested the hypothesis that although such a pattern predicts support for a strong non-democratic leader in democracies, it should produce decreased support for a strong non-democratic leader in non-democracies (where the presence of such leaders is the political status quo). Using three waves of World Values Survey data (2005-2020), as predicted, we found that in democracies, low economic development, high inequality, and low interpersonal trust predicted support for a strong non-democratic leader. However, in non-democracies, support for a strong non-democratic leader was higher in more economically developed countries and among individuals with higher social trust. These results contradict modernization theory’s proposition that development promotes support for democratic rule and suggest that economic development reinforces support for the existing political system.},

  author = {Zachmann, Karl},
  abstract = {This action research project examines what impacts, if any, increased use of gender equitable teaching strategies (GETS)--with an emphasis on the use of female role models—has on young women’s interest in STEM education and career pathways. The research was conducted in elective secondary (9-12) STEM courses in a large suburban high school. All 89 enrolled in the courses received access to the education enrichments provided in this study. Data was collected from 18 young women in class as well as 12 additional girls who participated in a focus group. Students were given the opportunity to engage with women employed in a variety of STEM fields. Additionally, the classroom instruction and curriculum were modified to include more of the seven strategies identified as being critically important to achieve gender equitable outcomes in STEM courses (TPT, 2013) including: collaboration, student-focused instruction, growth mindset, culturally responsive pedagogy, and creative problem solving. The impact of these educational enrichments was measured through the use of: a STEM-identity survey; enrollment data; participant rankings of the effectiveness of instructional strategies used, role model feedback responses, and analysis of data recorded in a Women in STEM focus group. The results indicate that exposure to female role models and gender equitable teaching strategies were positive as evidenced in three important areas. Notably, female student’s attitudes towards STEM improved; more female students elected to take advanced STEM courses than had in the previous two years; and, participants expressed increased confidence and interest in a future STEM pathway.},

  abstract = {This study presents an attempt to develop a short (15 item) version of the Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) scale (Altemeyer, 1998). Participants were three samples of high school and university students (17–50 years old). The scale developed had items that were shorter, with less extreme wording, and less reference to specific groups (e.g., women, homosexuals), i.e., relating to attitudes to be predicted from RWA, rather than being part of the RWA concept itself. The scale displayed reliabilities (Cronbach’s alpha) varying between 0.72 and 0.80 in the three samples. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the short RWA scale substantially contributed to the variance in ethnic tolerance, racism, and sexism (when controlling for social dominance orientation). It was discussed that this version of the RWA scale presumably taps a somewhat narrower authoritarianism concept, but still functions as predicted from theory and earlier research.},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different institutional and individual factors affect the data sharing behavior of authors of research articles in sociology and political science. Design/methodology/approach Desktop research analyzed attributes of sociology and political science journals (n=262) from their websites. A second data set of articles (n=1,011; published 2012-2014) was derived from ten of the main journals (five from each discipline) and stated data sharing was examined. A survey of the authors used the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine motivations, behavioral control, and perceived norms for sharing data. Statistical tests (Spearman's ρ, χ2) examined correlations and associations. Findings Although many journals have a data policy for their authors (78 percent in sociology, 44 percent in political science), only around half of the empirical articles stated that the data were available, and for only 37 percent of the articles could the data be accessed. Journals with higher impact factors, those with a stated data policy, and younger journals were more likely to offer data availability. Of the authors surveyed, 446 responded (44 percent). Statistical analysis indicated that authors' attitudes, reported past behavior, social norms, and perceived behavioral control affected their intentions to share data. Research limitations/implications Less than 50 percent of the authors contacted provided responses to the survey. Results indicate that data sharing would improve if journals had explicit data sharing policies but authors also need support from other institutions (their universities, funding councils, and professional associations) to improve data management skills and infrastructures. Originality/value This paper builds on previous similar research in sociology and political science and explains some of the barriers to data sharing in social sciences by combining journal policies, published articles, and authors' responses to a survey.},

With the recent open-science movement, there has been a call for free access to data, tools and methods in academia. In recent years, subject-based and institutional repositories and data centres have emerged along with online publishing. Many scientific records, including published articles and data, have been made available via new platforms. In the United Kingdom, most major research funders had a data policy and require researchers to include a `data-sharing plan' when applying for funding. However, there are a number of barriers to the full-scale adoption of data sharing. Those barriers are not only technical, but also psychological and social. A survey was conducted with over 1800 UK-based academics to explore the extent of support of data sharing and the characteristics and factors associated with data-sharing practice. It found that while most academics recognised the importance of sharing research data, most of them had never shared or reused research data. There were differences in the extent of data sharing between different gender, academic disciplines, age and seniority. It also found that the awareness of Research Council UK's (RCUK) Open-Access (OA) policy, experience of Gold and Green OA publishing, attitudes towards the importance of data sharing and experience of using secondary data were associated with the practice of data sharing. A small group of researchers used social media such as Twitter, blogs and Facebook to promote the research data they had shared online.

  abstract = {Self-categorization theory explicitly recognizes the possibility that distinct identities have “nested” relationships among themselves, so that there is no incompatibility or conflict among them, as they are located at different levels of abstraction for the subjects. Our objective was to test this premise through the study of an idiosyncratic case: the identification with Chilean regions, created more than 30 years ago by the central government with few socio-historic roots. Some 504 university students (randomly selected) in two distinct regions were surveyed. The results indicate that these regions have served as a reference in the self-concept of the individuals surveyed. The participants showed high levels of regional identity, which appear to be complementary and compatible with high levels of identification with the values of benevolence and universalism (measured with the Schwartz value scale), as well as positive attitudes towards other regional groups. All this indicates that these emerging regional identities would be compatible with the traditional Chilean identity in which they are embedded.},
