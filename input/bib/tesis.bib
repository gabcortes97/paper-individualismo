  abstract = {The sociological study of individuation processes in modern occidental societies has mobilized the thesis of institutional individualism as a key concept. This article argues that this thesis may not be appropriate to understand societies with different cultural traditions and institutional practices. Based upon the results of qualitative research conducted in Chile the article discusses the existence of a specific path to individuation in this society. The data show the analytical preeminence within the individuation process in Chile of a group of competences that must be generated and developed in confronting social life itself. Individuation leads in Chile to the constitution of relational hyper-actors based upon four dimensions: self-effort, abilities, interpersonal relationships and pragmatic consistency. This is what we propose to understand as agentic individualism.},

When democracies appear unable to address problems, introverted and closed-\-minded citizens defer to authoritarian leaders for efficient solutions.

Se entrevist{\'o} a 1 mil 759 estudiantes de seis bachilleratos distintos, a trav{\'e}s de un muestreo no probabil{\'i}stico, por cuotas. Los resultados muestran que la madre o tutora es la figura que m{\'a}s influye en la elecci{\'o}n de una carrera STEM en comparaci{\'o}n con el padre o tutor. Se pens{\'o} que los hermanos podr{\'i}an tener un efecto mayor en los estudiantes, no obstante, los resultados muestran que no es significativo que tengan o no hermanos y que estos puedan influir en la elecci{\'o}n de carrera. Sin embargo, es necesario profundizar m{\'a}s en el estudio de los hermanos mayores que egresan de carreras STEM y el efecto que esto tiene en la elecci{\'o}n de los hermanos menores, aspecto que no se abord{\'o} en la investigaci{\'o}n. El estudio no profundizo en variables como: el tipo de carrera y el rol laboral que desempe{\~n}an los padres y si est{\'a} o no relacionado con las {\'a}reas STEM. Se concluye que las familias deben realizar actividades no formales que ayuden a despertar el inter{\'e}s en la ciencia y aumentar su capital cultural desde edades tempranas. Society experiences scientific and technological changes that are forcing economies to focus their attention on the development of human capital with a profile in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This article aims to demonstrate the influence of the family (mother or guardian father or guardian and siblings) on the choice of STEM careers in high school students during their second and sixth semester, since choosing a career is an individual and family decision. A total of 1,759 students from six different high schools were interviewed, through a non-probabilistic sampling, by quotas. The results show that the mother or guardian is the figure that most influences the choice of a STEM career compared to the father or guardian. It was thought that siblings could have a greater effect on students, however, the results show that it is not significant that they have siblings or that siblings can influence their choice. However, it is necessary to go deeper into the study of older brothers who graduate from STEM degrees and the effect this has on the younger brother's election, an aspect that was not addressed in the investigation. The study did not delve into variables such as the type of career and the labor role played by parents and whether or not it is related to STEM areas. In conclusion, families must carry out non-formal activities that help awaken interest in science and increase their cultural capital from an early age.},

However, there are very few cross-cultural studies contrasting these two cultures against each other, as most studies in this field compare them to Western culture. Self-construal is one of the most used constructs to explain cultural differences, elucidating whether individuals of a cultural group see themselves as independent of their environment and others, focusing on personal motivations, or interdependent of others and their context, recognizing their role within it. This study intends to compare the self-construal of Chileans and South Koreans and observe the variability in the presence of these dimensions in these two cultures. A total of 200 participants from Chile and South Korea responded to the Self-Construal Scale. Chileans presented significantly higher scores on independent and interdependent self-construal simultaneously when compared to South Koreans. Also, Chileans presented higher scores on independent self-construal than on interdependent self-construal, while Koreans did not show a preference for either dimension. These results are consistent with previous studies on Chileans, implying that not all Latin American countries would adhere to collectivism.},

A prototypic person-oriented approach has three characteristics: (1) A pattern focus, (2) A focus on the individual, and (3) A process focus. The approach includes a theoretical framework, based on the holistic-interactionistic research paradigm, and it usually implies using methods for studying individual development, particularly subject-specific methods, and methods for studying patterns of information as undivided ``wholes''. Four papers in this special issue are theory-oriented, dealing with historical roots of the approach, implications of a person-oriented theory for the methodology applied in empirical research, and discussing conceptual issues, including definitions of terms and communalities and differences of a person-oriented approach to standard approaches. The next three articles concern the use of various forms of a multi-level approach that points to promising ways for further development of the person-oriented approach. In the penultimate article, a statistical package for person-oriented analysis (ROPstat) is introduced. In the last article, a dynamic systems approach is presented for studying adaptive equilibrium regulation that separates forces working at a short and a long timescale.},

Its particular focus is on how to assess the success of theories in dealing with some specific phenomenon. We are interested in how to differentiate between cases where a theory offers an unsatisfactory acknowledgment of a specified phenomenon and those where a theory offers a deeper, more systematic understanding. We address these metatheoretical issues by developing Parsons's analysis of positive and residual categories in various respects, including a focus on mutual support as the basis of positivity, differentiating synectic (reconcilable) and antinomic (irreconcilable) residual categories, and distinguishing divisions that are central to systems from those between center and periphery. We also consider how this conceptual toolkit can be put into practice.},

We identify major contradictions between the two culture models, which result in contradictory relationships with external variables such as economic prosperity. We critically evaluate the content validity of the items used to measure this construct in both models. Based on our analysis, we suggest that Hofstede's Individualism--Collectivism index be relabelled as Self-orientation vs Work-orientation and GLOBE's In-group collectivism as Family Collectivism. We demonstrate how the proposed alternative conceptualizations of the Individualism--Collectivism dimensions in both the Hofstede and GLOBE models can help reconcile the anomalous relationships between these two models of national culture, and between their dimension scores and other external variables of interest to researchers. We recommend a way forward for future research incorporating the collectivism dimensions that identifies which of the Hofstede/GLOBE scores is appropriate for differing purposes. This will help to make future research findings clearer, and to reduce contradictions and anomalies. Implications drawn from such research should also be clearer as a result.},

Using new expert-coded measures for 164 countries from the Varieties of Democracy project, we examine the political rhetoric--action link using using fixed effects models. The results confirm that shifts towards personalist legitimacy claims are no cheap talk but oftentimes important warning signals for a substantial deterioration of democratic quality, manifested in weaker judicial and legislative oversight of the executive branch. However, in contrast to much current concern, we show that liberal democracies seem to largely escape the negative repercussions of government discourses that increasingly stress the uniqueness of the ruler.},

The support profiles better predict these behaviors than the classic Linzian and Churchillian measures of democratic support.

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that schools often justify student performance differences using meritocratic ideals. One potential consequence of such ideals is the legitimization of outcome inequalities across various spheres, including those traditionally associated with equality and redistribution. In this study, we argue that the promotion of meritocratic values during school age can shape students' beliefs about meritocracy and influence their views on market-based access to health, pensions, and education. Using data from the 2017 National Study of Civic Education in Chile, which includes 5047 eighth-grade students from 231 schools, we estimated a series of multilevel models (lme4 library, R version 4.1.3) to test our hypotheses. Our findings show that a significant proportion of Chilean students agree with market justice principles---more so than adults. Most students endorse meritocratic views, particularly the notion that effort should be rewarded, which strongly correlates with market justice preferences: students who believe in meritocracy are more likely to justify inequalities based on financial capacity. At the school level, market justice preferences are higher in high-status schools but lower in schools with higher academic achievement. Furthermore, the conditional influence of meritocratic beliefs diminishes in schools with higher socioeconomic status and performance levels. These results suggest that the association between meritocratic beliefs and market justice preferences is already established at school age and is shaped by the school environment.},

The article explores the latter topic by drawing on recent comparative survey data from nine countries, both young and consolidated democracies from Europe and Latin America. Two individual-level characteristics trigger particularly strong support for the replacement of politicians with experts: low political efficacy and authoritarian values. They are complemented by a third, somewhat weaker factor: corruption perception. At the macro level, technocracy appeals to citizens of countries where the quality of democracy is deficient and where technocratic cabinets are a part of historical legacy. Surprisingly, civic activism and, partially, satisfaction with democracy enhance technocratic orientation, indicating such attitudes are not expressions of alienation or depoliticisation.},

In this sense, this study focuses on the Chilean context, and concentrates the analysis in the upper tail of the scores ---where the actual university admission is occurring---, and lower ---where potential lack of learning opportunities is exposed--- of the University Selection Test (PSU). At the same time, gender gaps are compared for the 2014-2018 period in the mentioned top and bottom zones of the distribution of test scores. Results indicate that there are persistent gaps that limit the possibilities for women to pursue university careers in areas related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Therefore, it is important that both public and university policies consider affirmative and complementary actions that may address these issues, considering the ongoing higher education reform and possible changes into the Chilean university admission system.},

However, it is worth pointing out that the gap is not uniform in all STEM fields. Women's underrepresentation is more marked in physics, engineering, and computer science fields. Nowadays, the labor market is becoming more competitive, technology-based and demands a diverse workforce. Therefore, it is important to continue promoting the participation of women in STEM, and the universities play a leading role in it. Previous research has shown that early learning experiences in STEM can show female students that they can succeed in this fields. This paper describes a model for developing programming courses for pre-university students to promote the participation of young women in STEM programs. The course was developed in one week, 25 students (16 girls and 9 boys) participated. The instructors of the course were four female professors. The programming language was Python, and the methodology used case-based learning. Both instructors and students gave positive comments on their experience in the course. The proposed model, including instruments, learning resources, and methodology, can be replicated and adapted to be used even in other learning fields.},

It subsequently reconstructs three predominant interpretations of this general script, i.e. utilitarian, moral and expressive individualism. For each variant, the intellectual genesis and overall definition of the institutionalization in specific societal domains and the dominant articulations in social theory are briefly presented. With this threefold distinction, the aim is to synthesize the extensive literature on individualism and to show the sociological strengths of approaching subjectivity in terms of institutionalized scripts.},

For the case of the German right-wing populist party Alternative f{\"u}r Deutschland (AfD) the authors propose a complex definition of rurality, and perform a quantitative small-scale analysis of the national election results in Germany in 2017. They examine the potential connection between a high share of votes for the AfD and the rurality of a municipality. The results show that in eastern Germany, the fairly rural municipalities have comparatively high AfD vote shares, whereas in western Germany, the fairly rural and the non-rural municipalities have similar AfD vote shares. Therefore, it appears that the thesis that rural areas are the source of the support of right-wing populism applies to some, but not to all rural areas of Germany.},

Today, however, the conditions seem to be ripe for the consolidation of the PRR in the country. As we show in this contribution, Jos{\'e} Antonio Kast and the Partido Republicano advance a programmatic agenda that emphasizes authoritarian, nativist, and populist ideas. We also demonstrate certain peculiarities of this political project, which differentiates it from its European brethren. In fact, the party has adopted very clear neoliberal positions and puts much more emphasis on outgroup distinctions within rather than outside the nation. Moreover, given that Jos{\'e} Antonio Kast and the Partido Republicano maintain a very fluid relationship with the mainstream right, collaboration between the two seems much simpler and more feasible than in most European cases.},

This follows from assumptions that these parties have rhetorical, stylistic and practical critiques of liberal democracy that appeal to people with politically authoritarian attitudes. I use Module 5 Comparative Study of Electoral Systems data and Wave 7 World Values Survey data to test how authoritarian attitudes, in particular, approval of strong, unchecked leaders, may be associated with support for RRP parties. Of 12 unique cases where RRP parties received at least 5\% support in a recent election, in most cases preferences for strong, unchecked leaders differentiated RRP party supporters from supporters of other parties generally, and from supporters of centre-right parties. In some cases, negative views of democracy, and acceptance of army rule, also characterized RRP supporters. Most cases have evidence consistent with the hypotheses, with the strongest evidence from supporters of Austria's FP{\"O} and Germany's AfD.},

  abstract = {Recent research to analyze and discuss cultural differences has employed a combination of five major dimensions of individualism--collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, femininity--masculinity (gender role differentiation), and long-term orientation. Among these dimensions, individualism--collectivism has received the most attention. Chronologically, this cultural attribute has been regarded as one, then two, and more recently, four dimensions of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism. However, research on this issue has not been conclusive and some have argued against this expansion. The current study attempts to explain and clarify this discussion by using a shortened version of the scale developed by Singelis et al. ((1995) Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: a theoretical and measurement refinement. Cross-Cultural Research 29(3): 240--275). Our analysis of aggregate data from 802 respondents from nine countries supports the expanded view. Data aggregation was based on the Mindscape Theory that proposes inter- and intracultural heterogeneity. This finding is reassuring to scholars who have been using the shortened version of the instrument because confirmatory factor analysis indicated its validity. The findings of the present study provides clarification of some apparent ambiguity in recent research in specifying some cultures such as India, Israel, and Spain as individualists or collectivists. By separating the four constructs, more nuanced classification is possible. Also, such a distinction enables us to entertain such concepts as the Mindscape Theory that proposes a unique intracultural and transcultural heterogeneity that do not stereotype the whole culture as either individualist or collectivist.},

The typical procedure is to create groups by splitting the original variable distribution at some cut point on the scale of measurement (e.g. mean, median, mode). Allegedly, dichotomization improves causal inference by simplifying statistical analyses. In this article, we address some of the adverse consequences of recoding quantitative variables into categories. In particular, we provide evidence that categorization usually leads to inefficient and biased estimates. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of data analysis can occur if scholars follow the recommendations presented in this article. The recodification of quantitative variables as categorical is a poor methodological strategy, and scientists must stay away from it.},

A total of 12 women who graduated between 2013 and 2017 were interviewed; six of them studied specialties that are traditional for women and six were trained in highly maledominated sectors. Our research, of a qualitative nature, leads us to question the concept of `choice', since admission to this educational modality is strongly conditioned by economic and mobility factors. In the stage of selecting a specialty, it becomes apparent that there are subjective factors that motivate women to insert themselves into traditionally femaledominated areas or, instead, to challenge the gender mandates reproduced by some teachers or family members. After completing their secondary vocational and training education, the women often experience sexism and sexual harassment when engaging in internship programs, which, in some cases, generates disaffection towards male-dominated jobs. The decision to continue an educational project, to enter the working world, or to make both compatible, is mediated by socioeconomic restrictions, by maternity, and by the lack of family support networks. In summary, class, gender, geographic origin, and other variables intersect to condition the educational and professional trajectories of women.},

We adopt a network model in which nodes represent survey variables and edges their conditional associations. This allows us to conceptualize perceptions, beliefs, and judgments about inequality as a network of connected evaluative reactions. We analyze data from the 2019 ISSP Social Inequality Module for Chile, one of the most unequal countries in the world. Relying on a network approach, we systematically analyze the wide-ranging indicators measuring subjective inequality. Results show that conceptions regarding inequality, redistribution, taxation, and wages form a moderately connected unified belief system with a small-world structure. In addition, we stratify the sample by education, income, and social class, obtaining six attitude networks. We compare the structures of these networks, investigating differences in community membership, node centrality, and network connectivity, evidencing that people in lower social positions have a more multidimensional understanding of inequality. Our work contributes to social justice research by proposing an innovative conceptualization of these attitudes and providing evidence of their structural variation across different socioeconomic groups.},

These alternatives have become increasingly popular, especially in countries where strong political disaffection and previous favourable pro-expert attitudes exist simultaneously. The Spanish case is one of these settings, with the emergence of a political party, Ciudadanos (Citizens), that represents these ideas. This article contributes to the understanding of public opinion support for an expert government, its main motives, and social supports. We claim that experts are not so much a decision-making alternative as they are a desired piece of the decision-making process. Support for a more significant role for experts comes especially from those that credit them with ample technical capacities, but most citizens want them to work as a piece of representative government, not as an alternative to it. The article combines two types of evidence: A survey of a representative sample of the population, including innovative questions about support to expert governments, and 10 focus groups that allow a more in-depth comprehension of the support (and criticism) of an increased role for experts. The results provide a nuanced picture of the types of expert involvement sought and their respective social support.},

The introduction discusses ``what is authenticity,'' and how social sciences can address the question. The article argues that authenticity claims can be classified in different registers, which in turn are part of overarching, socio-historical regimes. The rise of the culture of authenticity is the product of a change in such regimes, which have shifted from a ``national-statist'' to a new consumerist or ``market'' regime in the wake of the consumer revolution of the 1960s and the latest wave of economic globalisation. The third section turns to the issue of religious authority, starting with the diagnosis that consumer cultures are prone to a shift from rational-legal to charismatic types of authority, in reference to Max Weber's typology. In response to the question as to why charismatic authorities arise in capitalist cultures, the article argues to their structural and coextensive nature. Finally, the last section revises Weber's typologies with the help of Mauss's Essay on the Gift and a contribution from sociologist Alain Caill{\'e} and develops some of their heuristic potential.},

The Chilean transition to democracy brought in its baggage the joy of the end of the dictatorship, at least for half of its citizen-voters, together with the sadness resulting from a deep conviction of irremediable defeat. This implied that dictatorship and democracy were no longer the old enemies of the 1920s and 1930s, no longer the opposites that the liberals placed before the communist enemy.},

  abstract = {We argue that support for parties of the radical right and left can usefully be understood as a problem of social integration---an approach that brings together economic and cultural explanations for populism. With comparative survey data, we assess whether support for parties of the radical right and left is associated with feelings of social marginalization. We find that people who feel more socially marginal---because they lack strong attachment to the normative order, social engagement, or a sense of social respect---are more likely to be alienated from mainstream politics and to support radical parties. We also find an association between indicators for recent economic and cultural developments often said to affect social status and feelings of social marginalization, especially among people with low incomes or educational attainment. We conclude that problems of social integration and subjective social status deserve more attention from scholars of comparative political behavior.},

  abstract = {From a systematic review of the existing literature in databases such as WoS, Scopus and Scielo and by making use of the PRISMA model, 25 articles on the relationship between gender and occupational segregation in the last 5 years in Chile have been analyzed. Horizontal occupational segregation begins at the very moment in which women choose their degree since it will have a repercussion in their future for it affects their future decisions, their future working life, their fields of expertise and even there are learning methodologies linked to gender. The presence of stereotypes and role models affecting the occupational breakdown by gender are catalysts of the intrinsic constraints (internalized beliefs) and extrinsic constraints (those linked to the norms and existing procedures, or the absence of them in higher education), since they discourage the irruption of women in fields which have been traditionally associated to men. With regards to higher education, women tend to enroll in the fields of health, education and social services whilst men focus on STEM fields. It is important to highlight that in Chile there are more women who enroll in the university regardless of the nature of the institution. However, there are fields of knowledge in which the gender gap is sharp. According to the data gathered by the Subsecretar{\'i}a de Educaci{\'o}n Superior of Chile, the gender gap in basic sciences is -0.1\% whilst it reaches a 65.7\% in Technology.},

Recently, it has been suggested that some of these gender gaps no longer exist; however, the picture is more nuanced, for women are represented well in some STEM fields (such as biology) and not in others (such as computer science).The current research employed survey methodology to explore the perceptions of 360 finalists and semifinalists of the prestigious Science Talent Search.Two cohorts of participants who were either in their late 30s (Cohort 2) or late 20s (Cohort 1) were contacted to investigate factors that influenced them to select or not select STEM college majors and occupations. Comparisons between men and women revealed that women recalled having lower self-efficacy in STEM in college than men, and fewer women selected STEM majors as undergraduates. Interest was cited as a major influence for occupational selection for both men and women. Proportionally, more women than men entered fields such as biology and fewer women entered fields such as engineering and physics/astronomy.\,A greater proportion of older women mentioned leaving STEM because of a lack of flexible hours and needing to attend to family responsibilities. Implications for education and future research are discussed.},

This article invokes uncertainty-identity theory to explore the role played by context-induced self-uncertainty in radicalization, violent extremism, and support for populist ideologies and autocratic leadership. Uncertainty-iden\- tity theory argues that people are motivated to reduce self and identity uncertainty, and that group identification satisfies this motivation. However, some groups and identities are more effective than others. Specifically, highly entitative groups with clearly defined prescriptive iden\- tities that are unambiguous and consensual -- identities that echo populist ideology, conspiracy theories and victimhood narratives. Self-uncertainty creates a need for leadership, in particular leaders who are populist, auto\- cratic and toxic. I introduce uncertainty-identity theory to focus on its account of ``extremism'' -- overviewing empirical support, and closing with discussion of warning signs of radicalization and speculations about pre\- ventative strategies.},

Roughly up to 50\% of voters in East Asia have delegative democratic attitudes, which are known to undermine democratic governance in new democracies. Understanding delegative democratic attitudes is thus closely linked to the question of why delegative democracy persists. Our theoretical analysis suggests that delegative democratic attitudes are associated with low support for democracy, a perception of the strong influence of interest groups on policy, and trust in a national leader who can counter the power of interest groups. Using Asian Barometer Survey data from East Asian countries, 2001--2011, we confirm the hypotheses. Our findings imply that transforming a delegative democracy into a consolidated democracy requires promoting support for democracy and preventing interest group dominance over public policy.},

Both at the individual level and the societal level of analysis, authoritarianism was correlated with vertical individualism and vertical collectivism but unrelated to horizontal collectivism.

The Chilean sample reports a higher score on both constructs. Both samples report the highest score on independence. The results are inconsistent with previous models that characterize Chile as collectivistic and Norway as individualistic. These characterizations are questioned. The findings also imply that a particular score on either independence or interdependence does not predict the score on the opposite variable.

However, the proportion of earned degrees for women in some of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses continues to lag behind male baccalaureate completions (National Science Foundation, 2010). In addition, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT), only 21\% of information and computer science degrees were awarded to women in 2006 (NCWIT, 2007). In the past decade, higher education has experienced a rapid decline in the number of women involved in the information sciences, particularly computer science (Bank, 2007). A number of social and educational factors have been considered barriers to women entering STEM fields and this area has been well studied in the literature. However, research examining the relationship between gender differences and learning styles in the context of these technical fields is limited. According to Kolb (1976), people decide on a major based on how well the norms of the major fit with their individual learning styles. This paper presents gender differences in learning styles and recommends teaching methodologies most preferred for female learners in STEM courses. Further, a survey was administered to ascertain the extent the results of this study support previous findings.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that democracies are under threat around the world while the quest for strong leaders is increasing. Although the causes of these developments are complex and multifaceted, here we focus on one factor: the extent to which citizens express materialist and post-materialist concerns. We explore whether objective higher levels of democracy are differentially associated with materialist and post-materialist concerns and, in turn, whether this is related to the wish for a strong leader. Testing this hypothesis across 27 countries (N = 5,741) demonstrated a direct negative effect of democracies' development on the wish for a strong leader. Further, multi-level mediation analysis showed that the relation between the Democracy Index and the wish for a strong leader was mediated by materialist concerns. This pattern of results suggests that lower levels of democracy are associated with enhanced concerns about basic needs and this is linked to greater support for strong leaders.},

Both models can be called using a single simple command line. The basic latent class model is a finite mixture model in which the component distributions are assumed to be multi-way cross-classification tables with all variables mutually independent. The latent class regression model further enables the researcher to estimate the effects of covariates on predicting latent class membership. poLCA uses expectation-maximization and Newton-Raphson algorithms to find maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters.},

  abstract = {The gender gap in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) has drawn the attention of research and academic communities due to its impact in the Digital Society, targeting the fourth and fifth 2030 sustainable development goals of achieving quality education and gender equality. Recent studies show that women are enrolling STEM studies in smaller proportion than men and that they have a larger probability to renounce to their jobs or to take leaves. In this scenario, the involvement of educational institutions is seminal to change this trend. The School of Engineering of the University of Valencia (ETSE-UV), Spain, launched in 2011 a pilot program to promote STEM careers, focusing on increasing and retaining the number of female students choosing these studies. Building from this experience, the Girls4STEM project has been launched in 2019 with the aim of reaching female students from 6 to 18 years old, their families and teachers. In this paper, we present and motivate the project's objectives and main activities, framing them in current state of the art's literature. Preliminary results of the pilot program actions are presented, demonstrating the statistically significant impact on the percentage of enrolled female students and motivating the subsequent Girls4STEM project.},

Este trabajo analiza discursos sobre las desigualdades entre varones y mujeres (en interseccionalidad con otras) que circulan en 12 instituciones de educaci{\'o}n t{\'e}cnico profesional en dos provincias argentinas (Neuqu{\'e}n y Mendoza), y sobre los dispositivos de acompa{\~n}amiento a la escolaridad y articulaci{\'o}n con el trabajo que all{\'i} se construyen.

Como estrategia de an{\'a}lisis optamos por el An{\'a}lisis Cr{\'i}tico del Discurso. Encontramos tres tipos de discursos que organizan los modos de mirar, entender y actuar en relaci{\'o}n a ser var{\'o}n o mujer que se articulan con otras dimensiones con un sentido de justicia social particular. Definimos a estos discursos como: Naturalizaci{\'o}n de jerarqu{\'i}as; Visibilizaci{\'o}n de jerarqu{\'i}as; Visibilizaci{\'o}n de jerarqu{\'i}as y acciones para la transformaci{\'o}n. Si bien estos discursos conviven en todas las instituciones, identificamos predominancia de algunos en cada una de ellas, as{\'i} como en los territorios en que se asientan. Finalmente presentamos un caso de una instituci{\'o}n en el que analizamos el entramado discursivo.},

Recientemente, sin embargo, algunos estudios han encontrado indicios de un aumento en el desapego hacia los valores e instituciones democr{\'a}ticos. El presente estudio argumenta que una manifestaci{\'o}n espec{\'i}fica del distanciamiento hacia la democracia es la indiferencia pol{\'i}tica: la opini{\'o}n de que da lo mismo vivir en un r{\'e}gimen democr{\'a}tico que en uno autoritario. Este planteamiento se basa en un an{\'a}lisis de cuatro encuestas realizadas en 18 pa{\'i}ses de Am{\'e}rica Latina entre 2013 y 2017. La evidencia muestra que, si bien la preferencia por la democracia es mayoritaria en la regi{\'o}n, se trata de una mayor{\'i}a poco robusta. Un segmento considerable de la poblaci{\'o}n, no obstante, se declara indiferente antes que inclinarse por el autoritarismo. El an{\'a}lisis indica que la indiferencia pol{\'i}tica est{\'a} asociada con un mayor descontento con el desempe{\~n}o del sistema pol{\'i}tico. Asimismo, es m{\'a}s probable que las personas que se declaran indiferentes conf{\'i}en menos en los dem{\'a}s, que sean mujeres o j{\'o}venes, que tengan un bajo nivel educativo o que tengan un menor bienestar en el hogar. Estos resultados sugieren que, para un n{\'u}mero considerable de ciudadanos, la democracia es un referente abstracto que dif{\'i}cilmente alcanza motivar apego pol{\'i}tico.},

  abstract = {Based on an ethnographic research on early mothering with a small and heterogeneous group of women living in different areas of Santiago, Chile -- and a follow-up study six years later -- in this article we look closely at how mothering takes place through a sense of optimism while living in a hostile world, contrasting our findings with similar research in northern countries. Rather than waiting for opportunities to present themselves, women's sense of optimism is based on their own difficult experiences of learning to cope in a hostile world, and how this requires organizing their children's education to face challenges beyond their immediate family circle. We claim the existence of hyper-agentic motherhood -- one that articulates traditional maternalism, increasing societal demands on parenting and the specific take on individuation detached from institutions in neoliberal Chile. Mothering through optimism in a hostile world questions the possibility to import classed parenting models. We identify a resonance with Adrie Kusserow's description of hard individualism in which children are taught how to navigate the hostile world in the search for success, but with the difference that children in this context are brought up with the idea that mothers will be there for them in the long run, regardless of what actually takes place. This longitudinal study of parenting provides information on the usually silent processes of subjectification and emergent values that can be overlooked in times of social transformation.},

These studies have mostly looked at support for citizens or independent experts being given a greater role. Recently, Hibbing, Theiss-Morse, Hibbing and Fortunato have proposed a new battery of 21 survey items capturing the dimensions along which citizens' preferences for who should govern are organized. Testing their survey instrument among US respondents, they identified seven dimensions. In this study, we replicate their approach across nine European democracies, namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands. The replication allows, first, to compare citizens' preferences for political actors between the US and Europe, and within Europe. Second, it provides suggestions for how Hibbing and colleagues' battery might be adapted and re-used in other countries, enabling further cross-national comparative research on citizens' preferences for who should govern.},

For this, this study articulated the results of several empirical studies conducted from 2013 to 2019 with the conceptual tools in Danilo Martuccelli's sociology of the individual, especially its notions of tests, supports, and social textures. This research first addresses theoretical frameworks to implement its problem and methodological strategies to build and analyze youth's narratives. Then, it interpreted its data corpus around two central axes: a) lowincome territories, actors, and interworlds and b) young people, social participation, and reflexivities. Young people face a plurality of material and symbolic coercions in several low-income territories. However, these territories also create collective spaces in which youths establish personal and group identifications as they discover or generate sports, artistic-political, and educational proposals, which create intergenerational bonds, recover ancestral knowledge, and build referential and reflective landmarks, transforming territorialities into supports and a sign of recognition. Thus, studying youth narratives offers a privileged tool to analyze Latin American low-income agencies and individualities.},

Although there are no significant results in the academic performance of its female students, the evidence is conclusive regarding the association between taking a specialty subject with a female teacher and the persistence of its students of the same gender, even reaching an increase of 5.6 percentage points in the persistence of beginning students. This effect does not harm the educational trajectory of male students. The evidence is suggestive for working on policies designed to increase the hiring of female teachers in Higher Technical Professional Education in Chile.},

This is a survey-based descriptive study, with a sample of 558 administrative employees of three different organizations. Results support the idea that individualism and collectivism are not opposite dimensions, that coexist and may complement each other. The Chilean society remains collectivist but horizontal individualism is emerging and becoming more important. Both vertical and horizontal collectivism are positively related with age, years worked in the same place, and negatively associated with educational level. Women get higher ratings of horizontal individualism and men get higher vertical collectivism ratings. Using cluster analysis five different segments were found: independent collectivists, pure collectivists, idiocentric collectivists, alocentric individualists and renegades. Finally, potential causes and implications of these findings are discussed.},

Through a qualitative, descriptive and comparative study, 23 semistructured interviews were conducted with male and female teachers, engineers and technicians. Based on the theory of gender and ambivalent sexism, a thematic analysis was carried out, identifying categories and subcategories. Results verified that the female teachers are demanding and benevolent in their judgments, and the male teachers accentuate the attributes linked to the female students: order, responsibility and respect. Both segments transmit their own knowledge, regarding the ways of being, relating and developing and reflect dichotomies in their speeches, unconsciously hindering the training of young people. Therefore, it is a challenge for higher education programs to incorporate strategies that reverse ambivalences and the role that gender constructs play in the training of women, to modify the hidden academic culture that sustains segregation and the set of imperceptible resistances in professional training.},

The interactions are contradictory and are expressed in an open or covert manner, being recognized, yet hidden, they are disrespectful and at the same time subtle. As a consequence, discourse in words, gestures, and ambiguity in the way teachers teach, interferes with how students are taught and what students learn, especially in the case of disciplines associated with mining. Additionally, stereotypes underlie male-dominated academic cultures, although they are visibly complex, it is a contribution in analyzing other STEM disciplines in which women are, incidentally, highly segregated.},

In the context of the recent Trump administration, marked not only by authoritarian tendencies, ethno-nationalism, and hostility towards democratic institutions, but its denouement represented by the U.S. Capitol insurrection on January 6th, 2021 and the weeks that followed, what are the implications for growing spatialized civic and political divides, and indeed for democracy itself? I discuss several main approaches taken by social scientists to explain the relationship between spatial and political divides in the United States, including those that focus on shifting political geographies, cultural factors, economic anxiety, and racial resentment. Then, pointing to several recent exemplars, I identify theoretical, methodological, and perspectival strengths that the discipline of rural sociology can and should engage in developing explanatory frameworks for better understanding these social and spatial shifts -- shifts that are simultaneously crises of democracy and crises of epistemology.},

  abstract = {We investigated the impact of uncertainty on leadership preferences and propose that the conjunction of self-esteem level and stability is an important moderator in this regard. Self-threatening uncertainty is aversive and activates the motivation to regain control. People with high and stable self-esteem should be confident of achieving this goal by self-determined amelioration of the situation and should therefore show a stronger preference for democratic leadership under conditions of uncertainty. By contrast, people with low and unstable self-esteem should place their trust and hope in the abilities of powerful others, resulting in a preference for autocratic leadership. Studies 1a and 1b validate explicit and implicit leadership measures and demonstrate a general prodemocratic default attitude under conditions of certainty. Studies 2 and 3 reveal a democratic reaction for individuals with stable high self-esteem and a submissive reaction for individuals with unstable low self-esteem under conditions of uncertainty. In Study 4, this pattern is cancelled out when individuals evaluate leadership styles from a leader instead of a follower perspective.},

The scale also defines two dimensions of collectivism: (a) advice (seeking advice from people close to one, before taking decisions) and (b) harmony (seeking to avoid conflict).

But existing studies have a difficulty disentangling contextual effects (such as who is in power at the time of the survey) from individual differences (like which party one supports and how strongly). Moreover, we lack evidence on the causal antecedents of these attitudes. We propose a novel survey experimental design to strip away the political context through hypothetical scenarios, allowing allow us to identify citizens' differential support for democratic norms when their own party is in vs out of power. Our findings indicate a large degree of democratic hypocrisy among the American public: individual support for norm-eroding policies increases when their citizens' own party is in power, an effect further amplified by strong expressive partisanship and threat perceived from the opposing party.},

This study also examines the association between political placement and welfare attitudes. Data from the European Social Survey (N = 37,743 in 20 countries) are analyzed using a two-level regression analysis. The findings indicate that individualism at the cultural culture is a significant factor in terms of individuals' attitudes to welfare, in that the higher the level of individualism, the lesser the likelihood that the state's welfare responsibility is supported. On the other hand, citizens' attitudes towards state responsibility for welfare are associated with the political placement of those citizens. Politically, people leaning to the right have a lower degree of interest in the state's welfare responsibility. Furthermore, the degree of individualism modifies the association at the individual level of political placement and welfare attitudes. There is a greater attitudinal difference between the supporters of right-wing and left-wing political views in individualistic countries than in collectivist countries. From a social policy perspective, this study emphasizes the association of individualism and welfare attitudes. The results suggest that social policy is based more on national cultural values than one might assume.},

The fact that the discourse of security coproduction is interwoven with the individuation and privatization that characterize Chilean society calls for a review of the agenda of citizen participation in security issues.

This article shows the difficulties that female students face in male-dominated Vocational-Technical Education (VTE) programs during their experiences of internship in the workplace. To do this, based on 29 interviews of female graduates from these programs, we analyze the process of doing and undoing gender, and how women negotiate their gender when facing discrimination in the companies that host them as practitioners. The findings reveal women{\textasciiacute}s adjustment strategies that combine resistance and acceptance in a context where companies do not adjust their dynamics and practices to integrate them. Instead, women adapt their behaviors to the cultural norms of implicit and explicit sexism in the learning workplaces. Thus, the arrival of all female students to the companies is an opening act, which requires them to conquer their own space configured from exceptionality. This situation reduces the potential of apprenticeships to drive successful transitions to the labor market.},

In the current research, we tested the hypothesis that although such a pattern predicts support for a strong non-democratic leader in democracies, it should produce decreased support for a strong non-democratic leader in non-democracies (where the presence of such leaders is the political status quo). Using three waves of World Values Survey data (2005-2020), as predicted, we found that in democracies, low economic development, high inequality, and low interpersonal trust predicted support for a strong non-democratic leader. However, in non-democracies, support for a strong non-democratic leader was higher in more economically developed countries and among individuals with higher social trust. These results contradict modernization theory's proposition that development promotes support for democratic rule and suggest that economic development reinforces support for the existing political system.},

  author = {Zachmann, Karl},
  abstract = {This action research project examines what impacts, if any, increased use of gender equitable teaching strategies (GETS)--with an emphasis on the use of female role models---has on young women's interest in STEM education and career pathways. The research was conducted in elective secondary (9-12) STEM courses in a large suburban high school. All 89 enrolled in the courses received access to the education enrichments provided in this study. Data was collected from 18 young women in class as well as 12 additional girls who participated in a focus group. Students were given the opportunity to engage with women employed in a variety of STEM fields. Additionally, the classroom instruction and curriculum were modified to include more of the seven strategies identified as being critically important to achieve gender equitable outcomes in STEM courses (TPT, 2013) including: collaboration, student-focused instruction, growth mindset, culturally responsive pedagogy, and creative problem solving. The impact of these educational enrichments was measured through the use of: a STEM-identity survey; enrollment data; participant rankings of the effectiveness of instructional strategies used, role model feedback responses, and analysis of data recorded in a Women in STEM focus group. The results indicate that exposure to female role models and gender equitable teaching strategies were positive as evidenced in three important areas. Notably, female student's attitudes towards STEM improved; more female students elected to take advanced STEM courses than had in the previous two years; and, participants expressed increased confidence and interest in a future STEM pathway.},

  abstract = {This study presents an attempt to develop a short (15 item) version of the Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) scale (Altemeyer, 1998). Participants were three samples of high school and university students (17--50 years old). The scale developed had items that were shorter, with less extreme wording, and less reference to specific groups (e.g., women, homosexuals), i.e., relating to attitudes to be predicted from RWA, rather than being part of the RWA concept itself. The scale displayed reliabilities (Cronbach's alpha) varying between 0.72 and 0.80 in the three samples. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the short RWA scale substantially contributed to the variance in ethnic tolerance, racism, and sexism (when controlling for social dominance orientation). It was discussed that this version of the RWA scale presumably taps a somewhat narrower authoritarianism concept, but still functions as predicted from theory and earlier research.},

  abstract = {Self-categorization theory explicitly recognizes the possibility that distinct identities have ``nested'' relationships among themselves, so that there is no incompatibility or conflict among them, as they are located at different levels of abstraction for the subjects. Our objective was to test this premise through the study of an idiosyncratic case: the identification with Chilean regions, created more than 30 years ago by the central government with few socio-historic roots. Some 504 university students (randomly selected) in two distinct regions were surveyed. The results indicate that these regions have served as a reference in the self-concept of the individuals surveyed. The participants showed high levels of regional identity, which appear to be complementary and compatible with high levels of identification with the values of benevolence and universalism (measured with the Schwartz value scale), as well as positive attitudes towards other regional groups. All this indicates that these emerging regional identities would be compatible with the traditional Chilean identity in which they are embedded.},
